.. _Information:

Information
-----------

:menuselection:`System --> Information`
displays general information about the %brand% system.
:numref:`Figure %s <system_info_fig>` shows an example.

The information includes hostname, build version, type of CPU
(platform), amount of memory, current system time,
system uptime, number of users connected at the console or by
serial, telnet, or SSH connections, and current load average. On
systems supplied or certified by iXsystems, an additional
:guilabel:`Serial Number` field showing the hardware serial number is
displayed.

To change the system hostname, click the :guilabel:`Edit` button,
type in the new hostname, and click :guilabel:`OK`. The hostname must
include the domain name. If the network does not use a domain name,
add *.local* after the hostname.

After making any changes, click the :guilabel:`SAVE` button.

This screen also contains these buttons:

.. _saveconfig:

**Save Config:** save a backup copy of the current configuration
database in the format *hostname-version-architecture* to the computer
accessing the |web-ui|. Saving the configuration after
making any configuration changes is highly recommended. %brand%
automatically backs up the configuration database to the system
dataset every morning at 3:45. However, this backup does not occur if
the system is shut down at that time. If the system dataset is stored
on the boot pool and the boot pool becomes unavailable, the backup
will also not be available. The location of the system dataset can be
viewed or set using
:menuselection:`System --> System Dataset`.

.. note:: :ref:`SSH` keys are not stored in the configuration database
   and must be backed up separately.


There are two types of passwords. User account passwords for the base
operating system are stored as hashed values, do not need to be
encrypted to be secure, and are saved in the system configuration
backup. Other passwords, like iSCSI CHAP passwords, Active Directory
bind credentials, and cloud credentials are stored in an encrypted form
to prevent them from being visible as plain text in the saved system
configuration. The key or *seed* for this encryption is normally stored
only on the |os-device|. When :guilabel:`Save Config` is chosen, a dialog
gives the option to :guilabel:`Export Password Secret Seed` with the saved
configuration, allowing the configuration file to be restored to
a different |os-device| where the decryption seed is not already
present. Configuration backups containing the seed must be physically
secured to prevent decryption of passwords and unauthorized access.

.. warning:: The :guilabel:`Include Password Secret Seed` option is off
   by default and should only be used when making a configuration
   backup that will be stored securely. After moving a configuration
   to new hardware, media containing a configuration backup with a
   decryption seed should be securely erased before reuse.

**Upload Config:** allows browsing to the location of a previously
saved configuration file to restore that configuration.

**Reset Config:** reset the configuration database
to the default base version. This does not delete user SSH keys or any
other data stored in a user home directory. Since configuration
changes stored in the configuration database are erased, this option
is useful when a mistake has been made or to return a test system to
the original configuration.


.. index:: NTP Servers,
.. _NTP Servers:

NTP Servers
-----------

The network time protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time on the
computers in a network. Accurate time is necessary for the successful
operation of time sensitive applications such as Active Directory or
other directory services. By default, %brand% is pre-configured to use
three public NTP servers. If the network is using a directory service,
ensure that the %brand% system and the server running the directory
service have been configured to use the same NTP servers.

Available NTP servers can be found at
`<https://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/NTPPoolServers>`__.
For time accuracy, choose NTP servers that are geographically close to
the physical location of the %brand% system.

Click :menuselection:`System --> NTP Servers` and |ui-add|
to add an NTP server. :numref:`Figure %s <ntp_server_fig>` shows the
configuration options.
:numref:`Table %s <ntp_server_conf_opts_tab>`
summarizes the options available when adding or editing an NTP server.
`ntp.conf(5) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ntp.conf>`__
explains these options in more detail.

Boot Environments
-----------------

%brand% supports a ZFS feature known as multiple boot environments.
With multiple boot environments, the process of updating the operating
system becomes a low-risk operation. The updater automatically creates
a snapshot of the current boot environment and adds it to the boot
menu before applying the update.

#ifdef freenas
If an update fails, reboot the system and select the previous boot
environment, using the instructions in :ref:`If Something Goes Wrong`,
to instruct the system to go back to that system state.
#endif freenas

.. note:: Boot environments are separate from the configuration
   database. Boot environments are a snapshot of the
   *operating system* at a specified time. When a %brand% system
   boots, it loads the specified boot environment, or operating
   system, then reads the configuration database to load the
   current configuration values. If the intent is to make
   configuration changes rather than operating system changes, make a
   backup of the configuration database first using
   :menuselection:`System --> General --> SAVE CONFIG`.


As seen in :numref:`Figure %s <view_boot_env_fig>`, %brand% displays the
condition and statistics of the *Boot Pool*. It also shows the two boot
environments that are created when %brand% is installed. The system will
boot into the *default* boot environment and users can make their
changes and update from this version. The *Initial-Install* boot
environment can be booted into if the system needs to be returned to a
non-configured version of the installation.

Each boot environment entry contains this information:

* **Name:** the name of the boot entry as it will appear in the boot
  menu.

* **Active:** indicates which entry will boot by default if the user
  does not select another entry in the boot menu.

* **Created:** indicates the date and time the boot entry was created.

* **Space:** displays the size of the boot environment.

* **Keep:** indicates whether or not this boot environment can be
  pruned if an update does not have enough space to proceed. Click
  |ui-options| and :guilabel:`Keep` for an entry if that boot
  environment should not be automatically pruned.

Click |ui-options| on an entry to see these configuration buttons:

* **Delete:** used to delete the highlighted entry, which also removes
  that entry from the boot menu. Since an activated entry
  cannot be deleted, this button does not appear for the active boot
  environment. To delete an entry that is currently
  activated, first activate another entry, which will clear the
  *On reboot* field of the currently activated entry. Note that this
  button does not appear for the *default* boot environment as
  this entry is needed to return the system to the original
  installation state.

* **Clone:** makes a new boot environment from the selected boot
  environment.

* **Rename:** used to change the name of the boot environment.

* **Activate:** only appears on entries which are not currently set to
  :guilabel:`Active`. Changes the selected entry to the default boot
  entry on next boot. The status changes to :guilabel:`Reboot` and
  the current :guilabel:`Active` entry changes from
  :guilabel:`Now/Reboot` to :guilabel:`Now`, indicating that it
  was used on the last boot but will not be used on the next boot.

* **Keep:** used to toggle whether or not the updater can prune
  (automatically delete) this boot environment if there is not enough
  space to proceed with the update.

There are also other options available.

* **Create:** makes a new boot environment from the active environment.
  The active boot environment contains the text :literal:`Now/Reboot`
  in the :guilabel:`Active` column. Only alphanumeric characters,
  underscores, and dashes are allowed in the name.

* **Scrub Boot:** can be used to perform a manual scrub of the boot
  devices. By default, the |os-device| is scrubbed every 7 days. To
  change the default interval, change the number in the
  :guilabel:`Automatic scrub interval (in days)` field. The date and
  results of the last scrub are also listed in this screen. The
  condition of the |os-device| should be listed as *HEALTHY*.

* **Status:** click this button to see the status of the |os-device|.
  :numref:`Figure %s <status_boot_dev_fig>`,
  shows only one |os-device|, which is *ONLINE*.

.. note:: Using :guilabel:`Clone` to clone the active boot environment
   functions the same as using :guilabel:`Create`.

If the system has a mirrored boot pool, there will be a
:guilabel:`Detach` button in addition to the :guilabel:`Replace` button.
To remove a device from the boot pool, highlight the device and click
its :guilabel:`Detach` button. Alternately, if one of the |os-devices|
has an *OFFLINE* :guilabel:`Status`, click the device to replace,
then click :guilabel:`Replace` to rebuild the boot mirror.
#endif freenas
#ifdef truenas
If one of the |os-devices| has a :guilabel:`Status` of *OFFLINE*,
click the device to replace, select the new replacement device, and
click :guilabel:`Replace Disk` to rebuild the boot mirror.
#endif truenas

Note that
**the |os-device| cannot be replaced if it is the only |os-device|**
because it contains the operating system itself.

.. index:: Mirroring the |OS-Device|
.. _Mirroring the |OS-Device|:

Mirroring the |OS-Device|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the system is currently booting from a device, another device
can be added to create a mirrored |os-device|. If one device in a
mirror fails, the remaining device can still be used to boot the system.

.. note:: When adding another |os-device| for a mirror, the new device
   must have at least the same capacity as the existing |os-device|.
   Larger capacity devices can be added, but the mirror will only have
   the capacity of the smallest device. Different models of devices
   which advertise the same nominal size are not necessarily the same
   actual size. For this reason, adding another of the same model of
   |os-device| is recommended.

In the example shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <mirror_boot_dev_fig>`,
the user has clicked
:menuselection:`System --> Boot --> Status`
to display the current status of the |os-device|. The example
indicates that there is currently one device, *ada0p2*, its status is
*ONLINE*, and it is currently the only |os-device| as indicated by the
word *stripe*. To create a mirrored |os-device|, click either the
entry called *freenas-boot* or *stripe*, then click the
:guilabel:`Attach` button. If another device is available, it appears
in the :guilabel:`Member disk` drop-down menu. Select the desired
device.

The :guilabel:`Use all disk space` option gives control of how much
of the new device is made available to ZFS. The new device is
partitioned to the same size as the existing device by default.
Select :guilabel:`Use all disk space` to use all available space on
the new device. If either device in the mirror fails, it can be replaced
with another of the same size as the original |os-device|.

When :guilabel:`Use all disk space` is enabled, the entire capacity of
the new device is used. If the original |os-device| fails and is
removed, the boot mirror will consist of just the newer drive, and
will grow to whatever capacity it provides. However, new devices added
to this mirror must now be as large as the new capacity.

Click :guilabel:`SAVE` to attach the new disk to the mirror.

   Mirroring a |OS-Device|


After the mirror is created, the :guilabel:`Boot Pool Status` screen
indicates that it is now a *mirror*. The number of devices in the mirror
are shown as in :numref:`Figure %s <mirror_boot_status_fig>`.

Autotune
~~~~~~~~

#ifdef freenas
%brand% provides an autotune script which optimizes the system
depending on the installed hardware. For example, if a pool exists on
a system with limited RAM, the autotune script automatically adjusts
some ZFS sysctl values in an attempt to minimize memory starvation
issues. It should only be used as a temporary measure on a system that
hangs until the underlying hardware issue is addressed by adding more
RAM. Autotune will always slow such a system, as it caps the ARC.

The :guilabel:`Enable autotune` option in
:menuselection:`System --> Advanced`
is off by default. Enable this option to run the autotuner at boot.
To run the script immediately, reboot the system.

If the autotune script adjusts any settings, the changed values appear
in
:menuselection:`System --> Tunables`.
These values can be modified and overridden. Note that deleting
tunables that were created by autotune only affects the current
session, as autotune-set tunables are recreated at boot.

When attempting to increase the performance of the %brand% system, and
particularly when the current hardware may be limiting performance,
try enabling autotune.

For those who wish to see which checks are performed, the autotune
script is located in :file:`/usr/local/bin/autotune`.

.. index:: Self-Encrypting Drives
.. _Self-Encrypting Drives:

Self-Encrypting Drives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

%brand% version 11.1-U5 introduced Self-Encrypting Drive (SED) support.

Three types of SED devices are supported:

* Legacy interface for older ATA devices. **Not recommended for
  security-critical environments**

* TCG OPAL 2 standard for newer consumer-grade devices (HDD or SSD over
  PCIe or SATA)

* TCG Enterprise standard for newer enterprise-grade SAS devices

The %brand% middleware implements the security capabilities of
`camcontrol <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=camcontrol>`__ (for
legacy devices) and `sedutil-cli <https://www.mankier.com/8/sedutil-cli>`__
(for TCG devices). When managing SED devices from the command line, it is
important to use :command:`sedutil-cli` rather than camcontrol
to access the full capabilities of the device. %brand% provides the
:command:`sedhelper` wrapper script to ease SED device administration from
the command line.

By default, SED devices are not locked until the administrator takes
ownership of them. This is done by explicitly configuring a global or
per-device password in the %brand% |web-ui| and adding the password to
the SED devices.

Once configured, the system automatically unlocks all SEDs during the boot
process, without requiring manual intervention. This allows a pool to
contain a mix of SED and non-SED devices.

A password-protected SED device protects the data stored on the device
when the device is physically removed from the %brand% system. This allows
secure disposal of the device without having to first wipe its contents.
If the device is instead removed to be repurposed on another system, it
can only be unlocked if the password is known.

.. warning:: It is important to remember the password! Without it, the
   device is unlockable and its data remains unavailable. While it is
   possible to specify the PSID number on the label of the device with
   the :command:`sedutil-cli` command, doing so will erase the contents
   of the device rather than unlock it. Always record SED passwords
   whenever they are configured or modified and store them in a safe
   place!

When SED devices are detected during system boot, the middleware checks
for global and device-specific passwords. Devices with their own password
are unlocked with their password and any remaining devices, without a
device-specific password, are unlocked using the global password.

To configure a global password, go to :menuselection:`System -->
Advanced --> SED Password` and enter the
password. Recording the password and storing it in a safe place is
recommended.

To determine which devices support SED and their device names:

.. code-block:: none

 sedutil-cli --scan

In the results:

* **no** indicates a non-SED device
* **1** indicates a legacy TCG OPAL 1 device
* **2** indicates a modern TCG OPAL 2 device
* **E** indicates a TCG Enterprise device

To specify a password for a device, go to
:menuselection:`Storage --> Disks`. Click |ui-options| on the
confirmed SED device, then :guilabel:`Edit`. Enter and confirm the password
in the :guilabel:`SED Password` and
:guilabel:`Confirm SED Password` fields. Disks that have a configured
password show bullets in their row of the
:guilabel:`SED Password` column of :menuselection:`Storage --> Disks`.
Conversely, the rows in that column will be empty for disks that do
not support SED or which are unlocked using the global password.

Remember to take ownership of the devices:

.. code-block:: none

 sedhelper setup password

This command ensures that all detected SED disks are properly setup using
the specified password.

.. note:: Rerun :command:`sedhelper setup password` every time a new SED
   disk is placed in the system.

This command is used to unlock all available SED disks:

.. code-block:: none

 sedhelper unlock


.. index:: Email
.. _Email:

Email
-----

An automatic script sends a nightly email to the *root* user account
containing important information such as the health of the disks.
:ref:`Alert` events are also emailed to the *root* user account.
Problems with :ref:`Scrub Tasks` are reported separately in an email
sent at 03:00AM.

.. note:: :ref:`S.M.A.R.T.` reports are mailed separately to the
   address configured in that service.


The administrator typically does not read email directly on
the %brand% system. Instead, these emails are usually sent to an
external email address where they can be read more conveniently. It is
important to configure the system so it can send these emails to the
administrator's remote email account so they are aware of problems or
status changes.

The first step is to set the remote address where email will be sent.
Go to
:menuselection:`Accounts --> Users`,
click |ui-options| and :guilabel:`Edit` for the *root* user. In the
:guilabel:`Email` field, enter the email address on the remote system
where email is to be sent, like *admin@example.com*. Click
:guilabel:`SAVE` to save the settings.

Additional configuration is performed with
:menuselection:`System --> Email`,
shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <email_conf_fig>`.

Click the :guilabel:`SEND MAIL` button to verify that the
configured email settings are working. If the test email fails,
double-check that the :guilabel:`Email` field of the *root* user is
correctly configured by clicking the :guilabel:`Edit` button for
the *root* account in :menuselection:`Accounts --> Users`.

Configuring email for TLS/SSL email providers is described in
`Are you having trouble getting FreeNAS to email you in Gmail?
<https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/are-you-having-trouble-getting-freenas-to-email-you-in-gmail.22517/>`__.

.. note:: The %brand% user who receives periodic email is set in the
   :guilabel:`Periodic Notification User` field in
   :menuselection:`System --> Advanced`.


.. index:: System Dataset
.. _System Dataset:

System Dataset
--------------

:menuselection:`System --> System Dataset`,
shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <system_dataset_fig>`,
is used to select the pool which contains the persistent system
dataset. The system dataset stores debugging core files and Samba4
metadata such as the user/group cache and share level permissions. If
the %brand% system is configured to be a Domain Controller, all of
the domain controller state is stored there as well, including domain
controller users and groups.

.. note:: When the system dataset is moved, a new dataset is created
   and set active. The old dataset is intentionally not deleted by
   the system because the move might be temporary or the information
   in the old dataset might be useful for later recovery.

#endif truenas


The system dataset can optionally be configured to also store the
system log and :ref:`Reporting` information. If there are lots of log
entries or reporting information, moving these to the system dataset
will prevent :file:`/var/` on the device holding the operating system
from filling up as :file:`/var/` has limited space.

Use the drop-down menu to select the pool to contain the system
dataset.

#ifdef truenas
.. note:: Storing the system dataset on the
   :file:`freenas-boot` pool is recommended.
#endif truenas

To store the system log on the system dataset, enable the
:guilabel:`Syslog` option.

To store the reporting information on the system dataset, enable the
:guilabel:`Reporting Database` option. When this option is not enabled,
a RAM disk is created to prevent reporting information from filling up
:file:`/var`.

Click the :guilabel:`SAVE` button to save changes.

If the pool storing the system dataset is changed at a later time,
%brand% migrates the existing data in the system dataset to the new
location.

.. note:: Depending on configuration, the system dataset can occupy a
   large amount of space and receive frequent writes. Do not put the
   system dataset on a flash drive or other media with limited space
   or write life.

For Amazon S3, :guilabel:`Access Key` and
:guilabel:`Secret Key` values are found on the Amazon AWS
website by clicking on the account name, then
:guilabel:`My Security Credentials` and
:guilabel:`Access Keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key)`.
Copy the Access Key value to the %brand% Cloud Credential
:guilabel:`Access Key` field, then enter the :guilabel:`Secret Key`
value saved when the key pair was created. If the Secret Key value is
unknown, a new key pair can be created on the same Amazon screen.
The Google Cloud Storage :guilabel:`JSON Service Account Key` is found
on the
`Google Cloud Platform Console <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials>`__.

More details about individual :guilabel:`Provider` settings are
available in the `rclone documentation <https://rclone.org/about/>`__.

Tunables
--------

:menuselection:`System --> Tunables`
can be used to manage:

#. **FreeBSD sysctls:** a
   `sysctl(8) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sysctl>`__
   makes changes to the FreeBSD kernel running on a %brand% system
   and can be used to tune the system.

#. **FreeBSD loaders:** a loader is only loaded when a FreeBSD-based
   system boots and can be used to pass a parameter to the kernel or
   to load an additional kernel module such as a FreeBSD hardware
   driver.

#. **FreeBSD rc.conf options:**
   `rc.conf(5) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rc.conf>`__
   is used to pass system configuration options to the system startup
   scripts as the system boots. Since %brand% has been optimized for
   storage, not all of the services mentioned in rc.conf(5) are
   available for configuration. Note that in %brand%, customized
   rc.conf options are stored in
   :file:`/tmp/rc.conf.freenas`.


.. warning:: Adding a sysctl, loader, or :file:`rc.conf` option is an
   advanced feature. A sysctl immediately affects the kernel running
   the %brand% system and a loader could adversely affect the ability
   of the %brand% system to successfully boot.
   **Do not create a tunable on a production system before
   testing the ramifications of that change.**


Since sysctl, loader, and rc.conf values are specific to the kernel
parameter to be tuned, the driver to be loaded, or the service to
configure, descriptions and suggested values can be found in the man
page for the specific driver and in many sections of the
`FreeBSD Handbook
<https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/>`__.

To add a loader, sysctl, or :file:`rc.conf` option, go to
:menuselection:`System --> Tunables`
and click |ui-add| to access the screen shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <add_tunable_fig>`.

.. note:: As soon as a *Sysctl* is added or edited, the running kernel
   changes that variable to the value specified. However, when a
   *Loader* or *rc.conf* value is changed, it does not take effect
   until the system is rebooted. Regardless of the type of tunable,
   changes persist at each boot and across upgrades unless the tunable
   is deleted or the :guilabel:`Enabled` option is deselected.


Existing tunables are listed in
:menuselection:`System --> Tunables`.
To change the value of an existing tunable, click |ui-options| and
:guilabel:`Edit`. To remove a tunable, click |ui-options| and
:guilabel:`Delete`.

Restarting the %brand% system after making sysctl changes is
recommended. Some sysctls only take effect at system startup, and
restarting the system guarantees that the setting values correspond
with what is being used by the running system.

The |web-ui| does not display the sysctls that are pre-set when %brand% is
installed. %brand% |release| ships with the sysctls set:

#ifdef freenas

**Do not add or edit the default tunables.** Changing the default
tunables can make the system unusable.

The ZFS version used in |release| deprecates these tunables:

.. code-block:: none

   kvfs.zfs.write_limit_override
   vfs.zfs.write_limit_inflated
   vfs.zfs.write_limit_max
   vfs.zfs.write_limit_min
   vfs.zfs.write_limit_shift
   vfs.zfs.no_write_throttle

After upgrading from an earlier version of %brand%, these tunables are
automatically deleted. Please do not manually add them back.


.. _Update:

Update
------

%brand% has an integrated update system to make it easy to keep up to
date.


.. _Preparing for Updates:

Preparing for Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#ifdef freenas
It is best to perform updates at times the %brand% system is idle,
with no clients connected and no scrubs or other disk activity going
on. Most updates require a system reboot. Plan updates around scheduled
maintenance times to avoid disrupting user activities.

The update process will not proceed unless there is enough free space
in the boot pool for the new update files. If a space warning is
shown, use :ref:`Boot Environments` to remove unneeded boot environments.
#endif freenas

#ifdef truenas
An update usually takes between thirty minutes and an hour. A reboot
is required after the update, so it is recommended to schedule updates
during a maintenance window, allowing two to three hours to update,
test, and possibly roll back if issues appear. On very large systems, a
proportionally longer maintenance window is recommended.

For individual support during an upgrade, please open a ticket at
https://support.ixsystems.com, or call 408-943-4100 to schedule
one. Scheduling at least two days in advance of a planned upgrade
gives time to make sure a specialist is available for assistance.

Updates from older versions of %brand% before 9.3 must be scheduled
with support.

The update process will not proceed unless there is enough free space
in the boot pool for the new update files. If a space warning is
shown, use :ref:`Boot <Boot Environments>` to remove unneeded boot
environments.

Operating system updates only modify the |os-devices| and do not
affect end-user data on storage drives.

Available ZFS version upgrades are indicated by an :ref:`Alert` in the
|web-ui|. However, upgrading the ZFS version on
storage drives is not recommended until after verifying that rolling
back to previous versions of the operating system will not be
necessary, and that interchanging the devices with some other system
using an older ZFS version is not needed. After a ZFS version upgrade,
the storage devices will not be accessible by older versions of
%brand%.
#endif truenas


.. _Updates and Trains:

Updates and Trains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cryptographically signed update files are used to update %brand%.
Update files provide flexibility in deciding when to upgrade the system.
:ref:`Boot environments <If Something Goes Wrong>` make it possible to
test an update.

%brand% defines software branches, known as *trains*.
#ifdef freenas
There are several trains available for updates, but the |web-ui| only
displays trains that can be selected as an upgrade.

Update trains are labeled with a numeric version followed by a short
description. The current version receives regular bug fixes and new
features. Supported older versions of %brand% only receive maintenance
updates. Several specific words are used to describe the type of train:

* **STABLE:** Bug fixes and new features are available from this train.
  Upgrades available from a *STABLE* train are tested and ready to apply
  to a production environment.

* **Nightlies:**  Experimental train used for testing future versions of
  %brand%.

* **SDK:** Software Developer Kit train. This has additional tools for
  testing and debugging %brand%.

.. warning:: The UI will warn if the currently selected train is not
   suited for production use. Before using a non-production train,
   be prepared to experience bugs or problems. Testers are encouraged to
   submit bug reports at
   https://redmine.ixsystems.com/projects/freenas/issues.
#endif freenas
#ifdef truenas
There are several trains available for updates:

**For Production Use**

* **TrueNAS-11-STABLE** (Recommended)

  After new fixes and features have been tested as production-ready,
  they are added to this train. Following this train and applying any
  pending updates from it is recommended.

**Legacy Versions**

* **TrueNAS-9.10-STABLE**

  Maintenance-only updates for the previous branch of %brand%.

* **TrueNAS-9.3-STABLE**

  Maintenance-only updates for the older 9.3 branch of %brand%. Use
  this train only at the recommendation of an iXsystems support engineer.

.. warning:: **Only Production trains are recommended for regular usage.**
   Other trains are made available for pre-production testing and
   updates to legacy versions. Pre-production testing trains are
   provided only to permit testing of new versions before switching to
   a new branch. Before using a non-production train, be prepared to
   experience bugs or problems. Testers are encouraged to submit bug
   reports at https://redmine.ixsystems.com/projects/freenas/issues.

.. _Checking for Updates:

Checking for Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:numref:`Figure %s <update_options_fig>`
shows an example of the
:menuselection:`System --> Update`
screen.


.. _update_options_fig:

#ifdef freenas
.. figure:: images/system-update.png

   Update Options
#endif freenas
#ifdef truenas

   Update Options
#endif truenas


The system checks daily for updates and downloads an update if one
is available. An alert is issued when a new update becomes
available. The automatic check and download of updates is disabled by
unsetting :guilabel:`Check for Updates Daily and Download if Available`.
Click |ui-refresh| to perform another check for updates.

To change the train, use the drop-down menu to make a different
selection.

.. note:: The train selector does not allow downgrades. For example,
   the STABLE train cannot be selected while booted into a Nightly
   boot environment, or a 9.10 train cannot be selected while booted
   into a 11 boot environment. To go back to an earlier version
   after testing or running a more recent version, reboot and select a
   boot environment for that earlier version. This screen can then be
   used to check for updates that train.


In the example shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <review_updates_fig>`, information about the update
is displayed along with a link to the :guilabel:`release notes`. It is
important to read the release notes before updating to determine if any
of the changes in that release impact the use of the system.

.. _review_updates_fig:

.. figure:: images/system-update.png

   Reviewing Updates


.. _Saving_The_Configuration_File:

Saving the Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A dialog to save the system
:ref:`configuration file <saveconfig>` appears before installing
updates.

.. note:: The "Save Configuration" dialog can be disabled in
   |ui-settings| :guilabel:`Preferences`, although this is *not*
   recommended. Saving backups of configuration files allows recovery
   of the system after a boot device failure.

.. warning:: Keep the system configuration file secure after saving
   it. The security information in the configuration file could be
   used for unauthorized access to the %brand% system.


Applying Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure the system is in a low-usage state as described above in
:ref:`Preparing for Updates`.

Click :guilabel:`FETCH AND INSTALL UPDATES` to immediately download
and install an update.

The :ref:`"Save Configuration" <Saving_The_Configuration_File>` dialog
appears so the current configuration can be saved to external media.

A confirmation window appears before the update is installed. When
:guilabel:`Apply updates and reboot system after downloading` is
set and, clicking :guilabel:`CONTINUE` downloads, applies the
updates, and then automatically reboots the system.
The update can be downloaded for a later manual installation by
unsetting the
:guilabel:`Apply updates and reboot system after downloading` option.

:guilabel:`APPLY PENDING UPDATE` is visible when an update is
downloaded and ready to install. Click the button to see a
confirmation window. Setting :guilabel:`Confirm` and clicking
:guilabel:`CONTINUE` installs the update and reboots the system.

.. warning:: Each update creates a boot environment. If the update
   process needs more space, it attempts to remove old boot
   environments. Boot environments marked with the *Keep* attribute as
   shown in :ref:`Boot Environments` will not be removed. If space for
   a new boot environment is not available, the upgrade fails. Space
   on the boot device can be manually freed using
   :menuselection:`System --> Boot Environments`.
   Review the boot environments and remove the *Keep* attribute or
   delete any boot environments that are no longer needed.

During the update process a progress dialog appears. **Do not**
interrupt the update until it completes.


Manual Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updates can also be manually downloaded and applied using the
:guilabel:`INSTALL MANUAL UPDATE FILE` button.

The :ref:`"Save Configuration" <Saving_The_Configuration_File>` dialog
appears so the current configuration can be saved to external media.

After clicking :guilabel:`INSTALL MANUAL UPDATE FILE`, choose a
location to temporarily store the update file on the %brand% system.
Manual update file names end with :file:`manual-update-unsigned.tar`.
Use :guilabel:`Browse` to locate the downloaded manual update
file. Set :guilabel:`Reboot After Update` to reboot the system
after the update has been installed. Click
:guilabel:`APPLY UPDATE` to begin the update. A progress dialog is
displayed during the update. **Do not** interrupt the update.

.. tip:: Manual updates cannot be used to upgrade from older major
   versions.


#ifdef truenas
.. _Updating from the CLI:

Updating from the Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updates can also be performed from the :ref:`Shell` with an update
file. Make the update file available by copying it to the %brand%
system, then run the update program, giving it the path to the file:
:samp:`freenas-update {update_file}`.


.. _Updating an HA System:

Updating an HA System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the %brand% array has been configured for High Availability
(HA), the update process must be started on the active node. Once
the update is complete, the standby node will automatically reboot.
Wait for it to come back up by monitoring the remote console or the
|web-ui| of the standby node.

After the standby node has finished booting, it is important to
perform a failover by rebooting the current active node. This action
tells the standby node to import the current configuration and restart
services.

Once the previously active node comes back up as a standby node, use
:menuselection:`System --> Update`
to apply the update on the current active node (which was
previously the passive node). Once complete, the now standby node
will reboot a second time.


.. _If Something Goes Wrong:

If Something Goes Wrong
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an update fails, an alert is issued and the details are written to
:file:`/data/update.failed`.

To return to a previous version of the operating system, physical or
IPMI access to the %brand% console is required. Reboot the system and
press the space bar when the boot menu appears, pausing the boot.
Select an entry with a date prior to the update, then press
:kbd:`Enter` to boot into that version of the operating system before
the update was applied.

.. index:: CA, Certificate Authority
.. _CAs:

CAs
---

%brand% can act as a Certificate Authority (CA). When encrypting SSL
or TLS connections to the %brand% system, either import an existing
certificate, or create a CA on the %brand% system, then create a
certificate. This certificate will appear in the drop-down menus for
services that support SSL or TLS.

For secure LDAP, the public key of an existing CA can be imported with
:guilabel:`Import CA`, or a new CA created on the %brand% system and
used on the LDAP server also.

:numref:`Figure %s <cas_fig>`
shows the screen after clicking
:menuselection:`System --> CAs`.

To create an intermediate CA which is part of a certificate
chain, set the :guilabel:`Type` to *Intermediate CA*. This
screen adds one more option to the screen shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <create_ca_fig>`:

* **Signing Certificate Authority:** this drop-down menu is used to
  specify the root CA in the certificate chain. This CA must first be
  imported or created.

Imported or created CAs are added as entries in
:menuselection:`System --> CAs`.
The columns in this screen indicate the name of the CA, whether it is
an internal CA, whether the issuer is self-signed, the CA lifetime (in
days), the common name of the CA, the date and time the CA was created,
and the date and time the CA expires.

Click |ui-options| on an existing CA to access these configuration
buttons:

* **View:** use this option to view the contents of an existing
  :guilabel:`Certificate`, :guilabel:`Private Key`, or to edit the
  :guilabel:`Identifier`.

* **Sign CSR:** used to sign internal Certificate Signing Requests
  created using
  :menuselection:`System --> Certificates --> Create CSR`.

* **Export Certificate:** prompts to browse to the location to save a
  copy of the CA's X.509 certificate on the computer being used to
  access the %brand% system.

* **Export Private Key:** prompts to browse to the location to save a
  copy of the CA's private key on the computer being used to access
  the %brand% system. This option only appears if the CA has a private
  key.

* **Delete:** prompts for confirmation before deleting the CA.

Certificates
------------

%brand% can import existing certificates, create new certificates,
and issue certificate signing requests so that created certificates
can be signed by the CA which was previously imported or created in
:ref:`CAs`.

:numref:`Figure %s <initial_cert_scr_fig>`
shows the initial screen after clicking
:menuselection:`System --> Certificates`.

To import an existing certificate, click |ui-add| and set the
:guilabel:`Type` to *Import Certificate*.
:numref:`Figure %s <import_cert_fig>` shows the options.
When importing a certificate chain, paste the primary certificate,
followed by any intermediate certificates, followed by the root CA
certificate.

#ifdef truenas
On %brand% :ref:`High Availability (HA) <Failover>` systems, the
imported certificate must include the IP addresses or DNS hostnames of
both nodes and the CARP virtual IP address. These IP addresses or DNS
hostnames can be placed in the :guilabel:`Subject Alternative Name`
(SAN) x509 extension field.

To create a new self-signed certificate, set the
:guilabel:`Type` to *Internal Certificate* to see the options shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <create_new_cert_fig>`.
The configurable options are summarized in
:numref:`Table %s <cert_create_opts_tab>`.
When completing the fields for the certificate authority, use the
information for the organization. Since this is a self-signed
certificate, use the CA that was imported or created with :ref:`CAs`
as the signing authority.

If the certificate is signed by an external CA,
such as Verisign, instead create a certificate signing request. To do
so, set the :guilabel:`Type` to *Certificate Signing Request*. The
options from :numref:`Figure %s <create_new_cert_fig>` display, but
without the :guilabel:`Signing Certificate Authority` field.

Certificates that are imported, self-signed, or for which a
certificate signing request is created are added as entries to
:menuselection:`System --> Certificates`.
In the example shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <manage_cert_fig>`,
a self-signed certificate and a certificate signing request have been
created for the fictional organization *My Company*. The self-signed
certificate was issued by the internal CA named *My Company* and the
administrator has not yet sent the certificate signing request to
Verisign so that it can be signed. Once that certificate is signed
and returned by the external CA, it should be imported with a new
certificate set to *Import Certificate*. This makes the certificate
available as a configurable option for encrypting connections.

existing report does not already exist at
https://redmine.ixsystems.com/projects/freenas/issues.
If a similar issue is already present and has not been marked
*Closed* or *Resolved*, comment on that issue, adding new information
to help solve it. If similar issues have already been *Closed*
or *Resolved*, create a new issue and refer to the previous issue.

.. note:: Update the system to the latest version of STABLE
   and retest before reporting an issue. Newer versions of the software
   might have already fixed the problem.


To generate a report using the built-in :guilabel:`Support` screen,

.. index:: Failover

.. _Failover:

Failover
--------

If the %brand% array has been licensed for High Availability (HA),
a :guilabel:`Failover` tab is added to :guilabel:`System`.

%brand% uses an active/standby configuration of dual storage
controllers for HA. Dual-ported disk drives are connected to both
storage controllers simultaneously. One storage controller is active,
the other standby. The active controller sends periodic announcements
to the network. If a fault occurs and the active controller stops
sending the announcements, the standby controller detects this and
initiates a failover. Storage and cache devices are imported on the
standby controller, then I/O operations switch over to it. The standby
controller then becomes the active controller. This failover operation
can happen in seconds rather than the minutes of other configurations,
significantly reducing the chance of a client timeout.

The Common Address Redundancy Protocol
(`CARP <http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/carp.html>`__)
is used to provide high availability and failover. CARP was originally
developed by the OpenBSD project and provides an open source, non
patent-encumbered alternative to the VRRP and HSRP protocols.


.. warning:: Seamless failover is only available with iSCSI or NFSv4.
   Other protocols will failover, but connections will be disrupted
   by the failover event.


To configure HA, turn on both units in the array. Use the
instructions in the :ref:`Console Setup Menu` to log in to the
|web-ui| for one of the units (it does not matter which
one). If this is the first login, the :guilabel:`Upload License`
screen is automatically displayed. Otherwise, click
:menuselection:`System --> Support --> Upload License`.

Paste the HA license received from iXsystems and press :guilabel:`OK`
to activate it. The license contains the serial numbers for both units
in the chassis. After the license is activated, the
:guilabel:`Failover` tab is added to :guilabel:`System` and some
fields are modified in :guilabel:`Network` so that the peer IP
address, peer hostname, and virtual IP can be configured. An extra
:guilabel:`IPMI (Node A/B)` tab will also be added so that
:ref:`IPMI` can be configured for the other unit.


.. note:: The modified fields refer to this node as *This Node* and
   the other node as either *A* or *B*. The node value is hard-coded
   into each unit and the value that appears is automatically
   generated. For example, on node *A*, the fields refer to node *B*,
   and vice versa.


To configure HA networking, go to
:menuselection:`Network --> Global Configuration`.
The :guilabel:`Hostname` field is replaced by two fields:

* **Hostname (Node A/B):** enter the hostname to use for the other
  node.

* **Hostname (This Node):** enter the hostname to use for this
  node.

Next, go to
:menuselection:`Network --> Interfaces --> Add Interface`.
The HA license adds several fields to the usual :ref:`Interfaces`
screen:

* **IPv4 Address (Node A/B):** if the other node will use a static
  IP address, rather than DHCP, set it here.

* **IPv4 Address (This Node):** if this node will use a static IP
  address, rather than DHCP, set it here.

* **Virtual IP:** enter the IP address to use for administrative
  access to the array.

* **Virtual Host ID:** the Virtual Host ID (VHID) must be unique on
  the broadcast segment of the network. It can be any unused number
  between *1* and *255*.

* **Critical for Failover:** set this option if a failover should
  occur when this interface becomes unavailable. How many seconds
  it takes for that failover to occur depends upon the value of the
  :guilabel:`Timeout`, as described in
  :numref:`Table %s <failover_opts_tab>`.
  This option is interface-specific, allowing different
  settings for a management network and a data network. Note that
  setting this option requires the *Virtual IP* to be set and that at
  least one interface needs to be set as
  :guilabel:`Critical for Failover` to configure failover.

* **Group:** this drop-down menu is grayed out unless the
  :guilabel:`Critical for Failover` option is enabled. This option
  allows grouping multiple, critical-for-failover interfaces. In this
  case, all of the interfaces in a group must go down before
  failover occurs. This can be a useful configuration in a
  multipath scenario.

After the network configuration is complete, log out and log back in,
this time using the :guilabel:`Virtual IP` address. Pools and shares
can now be configured as usual and configuration automatically
synchronizes between the active and the standby node.

The passive or standby node indicates the virtual IP address that is
used for configuration management. The standby node also has a red
:guilabel:`Standby` icon and no longer accepts logins as all
configuration changes must occur on the active node.


.. note:: After the :guilabel:`Virtual IP` address is configured, all
   subsequent logins should use that address.

After HA is configured, an :guilabel:`HA Enabled` icon appears
to the right of the :guilabel:`Alert` icon on the active node.

When HA is disabled by the system administrator, the status icon
changes to :guilabel:`HA Disabled`. If the standby node is not
available because it is powered off, still starting up, or is
disconnected from the network, or if failover is not configured,
the status icon changes to :guilabel:`HA Unavailable`.

The icon is red when HA is starting up, disabled, or has encountered a
problem. When HA is functioning normally, the icon turns green.

The options available in
:menuselection:`System --> Failover`
are shown in
:numref:`Figure %s: <failover_fig>`
and described in
:numref:`Table %s <failover_opts_tab>`.

**Notes about High Availability and failovers:**

Booting an HA pair with failover disabled causes both nodes to come up
in standby mode. The |web-ui| shows an additional
:guilabel:`Force Takeover` button which can be used to force that node
to take control.

The %brand% version of the :command:`ifconfig` command adds two
additional fields to the output to help with failover troubleshooting:
:samp:`CriticalGroup{n}` and :samp:`Interlink`.

If both nodes reboot simultaneously, the GELI passphrase for an
:ref:`encrypted <Managing Encrypted Pools>` pool must be entered at the
|web-ui| login screen.
