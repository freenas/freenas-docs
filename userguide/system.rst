System
======

The System section of the administrative GUI contains these entries:

* :ref:`Information` provides general %brand% system information
  such as hostname, operating system version, platform, and uptime

* :ref:`General` configures general settings such as HTTPS access, the
  language, and the timezone

* :ref:`Boot` creates, renames, and deletes boot environments

* :ref:`Advanced` configures advanced settings such as the serial
  console, swap space, and console messages

* :ref:`Email` configures the email address to receive notifications

* :ref:`System Dataset` configures the location where logs and
  reporting graphs are stored

* :ref:`Tunables` provides a front-end for tuning in real-time and to
  load additional kernel modules at boot time

  updates

* :ref:`Cloud Credentials` is used to enter connection credentials for
  remote cloud service providers

* :ref:`Alert Services` configures services used to notify the
  administrator about system events.

* :ref:`CAs`: import or create internal or intermediate CAs
  (Certificate Authorities)

* :ref:`Certificates`: import existing certificates or create
  self-signed certificates

#ifdef freenas
* :ref:`Support`: report a bug or request a new feature.
#endif freenas
#ifdef truenas
* :ref:`Support`: view licensing information or create a support
  ticket.
#endif truenas

#ifdef truenas
* :ref:`Proactive Support`: enable and configure automatic proactive
  support (Silver or Gold support coverage only).
#endif truenas

#ifdef truenas
* :ref:`View Enclosure`: view status of disk enclosures.

#endif truenas


Each of these is described in more detail in this section.


.. _Information:

Information
-----------

:menuselection:`System --> Information`
displays general information about the %brand% system. An example is
seen in
:numref:`Figure %s <system_info_fig>`.

The information includes the hostname, the build version, type of CPU
(platform), the amount of memory, the current system time, the
system's uptime, the number of users connected at the console or by
serial, telnet, or SSH connections, and the current load average. On
systems supplied or certified by iXsystems, an additional
:guilabel:`Serial Number` field showing the hardware serial number is
displayed.

To change the system's hostname, click the :guilabel:`Edit` button,
type in the new hostname, and click :guilabel:`OK`. The hostname must
include the domain name. If the network does not use a domain name,
add *.local* after the hostname.

After making any changes, click the :guilabel:`Save` button.

This screen also contains these buttons:

**Reset Configuration to Defaults:** reset the configuration database
to the default base version. This does not delete user SSH keys or any
other data stored in a user's home directory. Since configuration
changes stored in the configuration database are erased, this option
is useful when a mistake has been made or to return a test system to
the original configuration.

**Save Config:** save a backup copy of the current configuration
database in the format *hostname-version-architecture* to the computer
accessing the administrative interface. Saving the configuration after
making any configuration changes is highly recommended. %brand%
automatically backs up the configuration database to the system
dataset every morning at 3:45. However, this backup does not occur if
the system is shut down at that time. If the system dataset is stored
on the boot pool and the boot pool becomes unavailable, the backup
will also not be available. The location of the system dataset can be
viewed or set using
:menuselection:`System --> System Dataset`.


.. note:: :ref:`SSH` keys are not stored in the configuration database
   and must be backed up separately.


There are two types of passwords. User account passwords for the base
operating system are stored as hashed values, do not need to be
encrypted to be secure, and are saved in the system configuration
backup. Other passwords, like iSCSI CHAP passwords, Active Directory
bind credentials, and cloud credentials are stored in an encrypted form
to prevent them from being visible as plain text in the saved system
configuration. The key or *seed* for this encryption is normally stored
only on the boot device. When :guilabel:`Save Config` is chosen, a dialog
gives the option to :guilabel:`Export Password Secret Seed` with the saved
configuration, allowing the configuration file to be restored to
a different boot device where the decryption seed is not already
present. Configuration backups containing the seed must be physically
secured to prevent decryption of passwords and unauthorized access.

.. warning:: The :guilabel:`Export Password Secret Seed` option is off
   by default and should only be used when making a configuration
   backup that will be stored securely. After moving a configuration
   to new hardware, media containing a configuration backup with a
   decryption seed should be securely erased before reuse.

**Upload Config:** allows browsing to the location of a previously
saved configuration file to restore that configuration. The screen
turns red as an indication that the system will need to reboot to load
the restored configuration.

**NTP Servers:** The network time protocol (NTP) is used to
synchronize the time on the computers in a network. Accurate time is
necessary for the successful operation of time sensitive applications
such as Active Directory or other directory services. By default,
%brand% is pre-configured to use three public NTP servers. If your
network is using a directory service, ensure that the %brand% system
and the server running the directory service have been configured to
use the same NTP servers.

Available NTP servers can be found at
`<https://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/NTPPoolServers>`__.
For time accuracy, choose NTP servers that are geographically close to
the %brand% system's physical location.

NTP servers are added by clicking
:menuselection:`NTP Servers --> Add NTP Server`
to open the screen shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <ntp_server_fig>`.
:numref:`Table %s <ntp_server_conf_opts_tab>`
summarizes the options available when adding an NTP server.
`ntp.conf(5) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ntp.conf>`__
explains these options in more detail.

.. _Boot:

Boot
----

%brand% supports a ZFS feature known as multiple boot environments.
With multiple boot environments, the process of updating the operating
system becomes a low-risk operation. The updater automatically creates
a snapshot of the current boot environment and adds it to the boot
menu before applying the update. If the update fails, reboot the
system and select the previous boot environment from the boot menu to
instruct the system to go back to that system state.

.. note:: Boot environments are separate from the configuration
   database. Boot environments are a snapshot of the
   *operating system* at a specified time. When a %brand% system
   boots, it loads the specified boot environment, or operating
   system, then reads the configuration database in order to load the
   current configuration values. If the intent is to make
   configuration changes rather than operating system changes, make a
   backup of the configuration database first using
   :menuselection:`System --> General --> Save Config`.

As seen in
:numref:`Figure %s <view_boot_env_fig>`,
two boot environments are created when %brand% is installed. The
system will boot into the *default* boot environment and users can
make their changes and update from this version. The other boot
environment, named *Initial-Install* can be booted into if the system
needs to be returned to a pristine, non-configured version of the
installation.

If the :ref:`Wizard` was used, a third boot environment called
:samp:`Wizard-{date}` is also created, indicating the date and time
the :ref:`Wizard` was run.

Each boot environment entry contains this information:

* **Name:** the name of the boot entry as it will appear in the boot
  menu.

* **Active:** indicates which entry will boot by default if the user
  does not select another entry in the boot menu.

* **Created:** indicates the date and time the boot entry was created.

* **Keep:** indicates whether or not this boot environment can be
  pruned if an update does not have enough space to proceed. Click
  :guilabel:`Keep` for an entry if that boot environment should not
  be automatically pruned.

Highlight an entry to view the configuration buttons for it. These
configuration buttons are shown:

* **Rename:** used to change the name of the boot environment.

* **Keep/Unkeep:** used to toggle whether or not the updater can prune
  (automatically delete) this boot environment if there is not enough
  space to proceed with the update.

* **Clone:** used to create a copy of the highlighted boot
  environment.

* **Delete:** used to delete the highlighted entry, which also removes
  that entry from the boot menu. Since you cannot delete an entry that
  has been activated, this button will not appear for the active boot
  environment. If you need to delete an entry that  is currently
  activated, first activate another entry, which will clear the
  *On reboot* field of the currently activated entry. Note that this
  button will not be displayed for the *default* boot environment as
  this entry is needed in order to return the system to the original
  installation state.

* **Activate:** only appears on entries which are not currently set to
  :guilabel:`Active`. Changes the selected entry to the default boot
  entry on next boot. Its status changes to :guilabel:`On Reboot` and
  the current :guilabel:`Active` entry changes from
  :guilabel:`On Reboot, Now` to :guilabel:`Now`, indicating that it
  was used on the last boot but will not be used on the next boot.

The buttons above the boot entries can be used to:

* **Create:** a manual boot environment. A pop-up menu prompts for
  entry of a :guilabel:`Name` for the boot environment. When entering
  the name, only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and dashes are
  allowed.

* **Scrub Boot:** can be used to perform a manual scrub of the boot
  devices. By default, the boot device is scrubbed every 7 days. To
  change the default interval, change the number in the
  :guilabel:`Automatic scrub interval (in days)` field. The date and
  results of the last scrub are also listed in this screen. The
  condition of the boot device should be listed as *HEALTHY*.

* **Status:** click this button to see the status of the boot devices.
  :numref:`Figure %s <status_boot_dev_fig>`,
  shows only one boot device, which is *ONLINE*.

If the system has a mirrored boot pool, there will be a

To remove a device from the boot pool, highlight the device and click
its :guilabel:`Detach` button. Alternately, if one of the boot devices
has an *OFFLINE* :guilabel:`Status`, click the device to replace,
then click :guilabel:`Replace` to rebuild the boot mirror.

The first entry is the active boot environment, or the one that the
system has been configured to boot into. To boot into a different boot
environment, press the :kbd:`spacebar` to pause this screen, use the
down arrow to select :guilabel:`Boot Environment Menu`, and press
:kbd:`Enter`. A menu displays the other available boot environments.
Use the up/down arrows to select the desired boot environment and
press :kbd:`Enter` to boot into it. To always boot into that boot
environment, go to :menuselection:`System --> Boot`, highlight that
entry, and click the :guilabel:`Activate` button.

.. index:: Mirroring the Boot Device
.. _Mirroring the Boot Device:

Mirroring the Boot Device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the system is currently booting from one device, you can add
another device to create a mirrored boot device. This way, if one
device fails, the system still has a copy of the boot file system and
can be configured to boot from the remaining device in the mirror.

.. note:: When adding another boot device for a mirror, the new device
   must have at least the same capacity as the existing boot device.
   Larger capacity devices can be added, but the mirror will only have
   the capacity of the smallest device. Different models of devices
   which advertise the same nominal size are not necessarily the same
   actual size. For this reason, adding another of the same model of
   boot device is recommended.

In the example shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <mirror_boot_dev_fig>`,
the user has clicked
:menuselection:`System --> Boot --> Status`
to display the current status of the boot device. The example
indicates that there is currently one device, *ada0p2*, its status is
*ONLINE*, and it is currently the only boot device as indicated by the
word *stripe*. To create a mirrored boot device, click either the
entry called *freenas-boot* or *stripe*, then click the
:guilabel:`Attach` button. If another device is available, it appears
in the :guilabel:`Member disk` drop-down menu. Select the desired
device.

The :guilabel:`Use all disk space` checkbox gives control of how much
of the new device is made available to ZFS. The default is unchecked,
and the new device will be partitioned to the same size as the
existing device. If either device in the mirror fails, it can be
replaced with another of the same size as the original boot device.

When :guilabel:`Use all disk space` is checked, the entire capacity of
the new device is used. If the original boot device fails and is
removed, the boot mirror will consist of just the newer drive, and
will grow to whatever capacity it provides. However, new devices added
to this mirror must now be as large as the new capacity.

Click :guilabel:`Attach Disk` to attach the new disk to the mirror.

After the mirror is created, the :guilabel:`Status` screen indicates
that it is now a *mirror*. The number of devices in the mirror are

Autotune
~~~~~~~~

#ifdef freenas
%brand% provides an autotune script which optimizes the system
depending on the installed hardware. For example, if a ZFS volume
exists on a system with limited RAM, the autotune script automatically
adjusts some ZFS sysctl values in an attempt to minimize ZFS memory
starvation issues. It should only be used as a temporary measure on a
system that hangs until the underlying hardware issue is addressed by
adding more RAM. Autotune will always slow such a system, as it caps
the ARC.

The :guilabel:`Enable autotune` checkbox in
:menuselection:`System --> Advanced`
is unchecked by default. Check this box to run the autotuner at boot
time. If you would like the script to run immediately, the system must
be rebooted.

If the autotune script adjusts any settings, the changed values appear
in
:menuselection:`System --> Tunables`.
These values can be modified and overridden. Note that deleting
tunables that were created by autotune only affects the current
session, as autotune-set tunables are recreated at boot.

When attempting to increase the performance of the %brand% system, and
particularly when the current hardware may be limiting performance,
try enabling autotune.

For those who wish to see which checks are performed, the autotune
script is located in :file:`/usr/local/bin/autotune`.

%brand% provides an autotune script which optimizes the system. The
:guilabel:`Enable autotune` checkbox in

While these values can be modified and overridden, speak to your

.. index:: Self-Encrypting Drives
.. _Self-Encrypting Drives:

Self-Encrypting Drives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

%brand% version 11.1-U5 introduced Self-Encrypting Drive (SED) support.

Three types of SED devices are supported:

* Legacy interface for older ATA devices (not recommended for
  security-critical environments)

* TCG OPAL 2 standard for newer consumer-grade devices (HDD or SSD over
  PCIe or SATA)

* TCG Enterprise standard for newer enterprise-grade SAS devices

The %brand% middleware implements the security capabilities of
`camcontrol <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=camcontrol>`__ (for
legacy devices) and `sedutil-cli <https://www.mankier.com/8/sedutil-cli>`__
(for TCG devices). When managing SED devices from the command line, it is
important to use :command:`sedutil-cli` (rather than camcontrol) in order
to access the full capabilities of the device. %brand% provides the
:command:`sedhelper` wrapper script to ease SED device administration from
the command line.

By default, SED devices are not locked until the administrator explicitly
configures a global or per-device password and initializes the devices.

Once configured, the system automatically unlocks all SEDs during the boot
process, without requiring manual intervention. This allows a pool to
contain a mix of SED and non-SED devices.

A password-protected SED device protects the data stored on the device
when the device is physically removed from the %brand% system. This allows
secure disposal of the device without having to first wipe its contents.
If the device is instead removed to be repurposed on another system, it
can only be unlocked if the password is known. 

.. warning:: It is important to remember the password! Without it, the
   device is unlockable and its data remains unavailable. While it is
   possible to specify the PSID number on the label of the device with
   the :command:`sedutil-cli` command, doing so will erase the contents
   of the device rather than unlock it. Always record SED passwords
   whenever they are configured or modified and store them in a safe
   place!

When SED devices are detected during system boot, the middleware checks
for global and device-specific passwords. Devices with their own password
are unlocked with their password and any remaining devices, without a
device-specific password, are unlocked using the global password.

To configure a global password, go to
:menuselection:`System --> Advanced --> SED Password` and input the
password. Be sure to record the password and store it in a safe place!

To determine which devices support SED and their device names:

.. code-block:: none

 sedutil-cli --scan

In the results:

* **no** indicates a non-SED device
* **1** indicates a legacy TCG OPAL 1 device
* **2** indicates a modern TCG OPAL 2 device
* **E** indicates a TCG Enterprise device

To specify a password for a device, go to
:menuselection:`Storage --> View Disks`. Highlight the device name for
the confirmed SED device and click Edit. Input and confirm the password
in the :guilabel:`Password for SED` and
:guilabel:`Confirm SED Password` fields. Disks that have a configured
password will show bullets in their row of the
:guilabel:`Password for SED` column of
:menuselection:`Storage --> View Disks`. Conversely, the rows in that
column will be empty for disks that do not support SED or which will be
unlocked using the global password.

Next, remember to initialize the devices:

.. code-block:: none

 sedhelper setup password

This command ensures that all detected SED disks are properly setup using
the specified password.

.. _note: Rerun that command every time a new SED disk is placed in the
   system.

This command can be used to unlock all available SED disks:

.. code-block:: none

 sedhelper unlock


.. index:: Email
.. _Email:

Email
-----

An automatic script sends a nightly email to the *root* user account
containing important information such as the health of the disks.
:ref:`Alert` events are also emailed to the *root* user account.
Problems with :ref:`Scrubs` are reported separately in an email sent
at 03:00AM.


.. note:: :ref:`S.M.A.R.T.` reports are mailed separately to the
   address configured in that service.


The administrator typically does not read email directly on
the %brand% system. Instead, these emails are usually sent to an
external email address where they can be read more conveniently. It is
important to configure the system so it can send these emails to the
administrator's remote email account so they are aware of problems or
status changes.

The first step is to set the remote address where email will be sent.
Select
:menuselection:`Account --> Users`, click on *root* to highlight
that user, then click :guilabel:`Modify User`. In the
:guilabel:`E-mail` field, enter the email address on the remote system
where email is to be sent, like *admin@example.com*. Click
:guilabel:`OK` to save the settings.

Additional configuration is performed with
:menuselection:`System --> Email`,
shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <email_conf_fig>`.

.. index:: System Dataset

.. _System Dataset:

System Dataset
--------------

:menuselection:`System --> System Dataset`,
shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <system_dataset_fig>`,
is used to select the pool which will contain the persistent system
dataset. The system dataset stores debugging core files and Samba4
metadata such as the user/group cache and share level permissions. If
the %brand% system is configured to be a Domain Controller, all of
the domain controller state is stored there as well, including domain
controller users and groups.

.. note:: When the system dataset is moved, a new dataset is created
   and set active. The old dataset is intentionally not deleted by
   the system because the move might be transient or the information
   in the old dataset might be useful for later recovery.

   System Dataset Screen
#endif truenas

.. note:: Encrypted volumes are not displayed in the
   :guilabel:`System dataset pool` drop-down menu.

The system dataset can optionally be configured to also store the
system log and :ref:`Reporting` information. If there are lots of log
entries or reporting information, moving these to the system dataset
will prevent :file:`/var/` on the device holding the operating system
from filling up as :file:`/var/` has limited space.

Use the drop-down menu to select the ZFS volume (pool) to contain the
system dataset. Whenever the location of the system dataset is
changed, a pop-up warning indicates that the SMB service must be
restarted, causing a temporary outage of any active SMB connections.

#ifdef truenas
.. note:: It is recommended to store the system dataset on the
   :file:`freenas-boot` pool. For this reason, a yellow system alert
   will be generated when the system dataset is configured to
   use another pool.
#endif truenas

To store the system log on the system dataset, check the
:guilabel:`Syslog` box.

To store the reporting information on the system dataset, check the
:guilabel:`Reporting Database` box. When this box is not checked, a
RAM disk is created to prevent reporting information from filling up
:file:`/var`.

Click the :guilabel:`Save` button to save changes.

If the pool storing the system dataset is changed at a later time,
%brand% migrates the existing data in the system dataset to the new
location.


.. note:: Depending on configuration, the system dataset can occupy a
   large amount of space and receive frequent writes. Do not put the
   system dataset on a flash drive or other media with limited space
   or write life.


.. index:: Tunables
.. _Tunables:

Tunables
--------

:menuselection:`System --> Tunables`
can be used to manage the following:

#. **FreeBSD sysctls:** a
   `sysctl(8) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sysctl>`__
   makes changes to the FreeBSD kernel running on a %brand% system
   and can be used to tune the system.

#. **FreeBSD loaders:** a loader is only loaded when a FreeBSD-based
   system boots and can be used to pass a parameter to the kernel or
   to load an additional kernel module such as a FreeBSD hardware
   driver.

#. **FreeBSD rc.conf options:**
   `rc.conf(5)
   <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rc.conf&manpath=FreeBSD+11.0-RELEASE>`__
   is used to pass system configuration options to the system startup
   scripts as the system boots. Since %brand% has been optimized for
   storage, not all of the services mentioned in rc.conf(5) are
   available for configuration. Note that in %brand%, customized
   rc.conf options are stored in
   :file:`/tmp/rc.conf.freenas`.

.. warning:: Adding a sysctl, loader, or :file:`rc.conf` option is an
   advanced feature. A sysctl immediately affects the kernel running
   the %brand% system and a loader could adversely affect the ability
   of the %brand% system to successfully boot.
   **Do not create a tunable on a production system unless you
   understand and have tested the ramifications of that change.**

Since sysctl, loader, and rc.conf values are specific to the kernel
parameter to be tuned, the driver to be loaded, or the service to
configure, descriptions and suggested values can be found in the man
page for the specific driver and in many sections of the
`FreeBSD Handbook
<https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/>`__.

To add a loader, sysctl, or :file:`rc.conf` option, go to
:menuselection:`System --> Tunables --> Add Tunable`,
to access the screen shown in shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <add_tunable_fig>`.

.. note:: As soon as a *Sysctl* is added or edited, the running kernel
   changes that variable to the value specified. However, when a
   *Loader* or *rc.conf* value is changed, it does not take effect
   until the system is rebooted. Regardless of the type of tunable,
   changes persist at each boot and across upgrades unless the tunable
   is deleted or its :guilabel:`Enabled` checkbox is unchecked.

Any added tunables are listed in
:menuselection:`System --> Tunables`.
To change the value of an existing tunable, click its :guilabel:`Edit`
button. To remove a tunable, click its :guilabel:`Delete` button.

Restarting the %brand% system after making sysctl changes is
recommended. Some sysctls only take effect at system startup, and
restarting the system guarantees that the setting values correspond
with what is being used by the running system.

The GUI does not display the sysctls that are pre-set when %brand% is
installed. %brand% |release| ships with the following sysctls set:

#ifdef freenas
.. code-block:: none

   kern.metadelay=3
   kern.dirdelay=4
   kern.filedelay=5
   kern.coredump=1
   kern.sugid_coredump=1

**Do not add or edit these default sysctls** as doing so may render
the system unusable.

   vfs.zfs.write_limit_max
   vfs.zfs.write_limit_min
   vfs.zfs.write_limit_shift
   vfs.zfs.no_write_throttle

After upgrading from an earlier version of %brand%, these tunables are
automatically deleted. Please do not manually add them back.


.. _Update:

Update
------

%brand% has an integrated update system to make it easy to keep up to
date.


.. _Preparing for Updates:

Preparing for Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#ifdef freenas
It is best to perform updates at times the %brand% system is idle,
with no clients connected and no scrubs or other disk activity going
on. A reboot is required after most updates, so they are often planned
for scheduled maintenance times to avoid disrupting user activities.

The update process will not proceed unless there is enough free space
in the boot pool for the new update files. If a space warning is
shown, use :ref:`Boot` to remove unneeded boot environments.
#endif freenas

#ifdef truenas
An update usually takes between thirty minutes and an hour. A reboot
is required after the update, so it is recommended to schedule updates
during a maintenance window, allowing two to three hours to update,
test, and possibly roll back if difficulties are encountered. On very
large systems, a proportionally longer maintenance window is
recommended.

For individual support during an upgrade, please open a ticket at
https://support.ixsystems.com, or call 408-943-4100 to schedule
one. Scheduling at least two days in advance of a planned upgrade
gives time to make sure a specialist is available for assistance.

Updates from older versions of %brand% before 9.3 must be scheduled
with support.

The update process will not proceed unless there is enough free space
in the boot pool for the new update files. If a space warning is
shown, use :ref:`Boot` to remove unneeded boot environments.

Operating system updates only modify the boot devices and do not
affect end-user data on storage drives.

Available ZFS version upgrades are indicated by an :ref:`Alert` in the
graphical user interface. However, upgrading the ZFS version on
storage drives is not recommended until after verifying that rolling
back to previous versions of the operating system will not be
necessary, and that interchanging the devices with some other system
using an older ZFS version is not needed. After a ZFS version upgrade,
the storage devices will not be accessible by older versions of
%brand%.
#endif truenas


.. _Updates and Trains:

Updates and Trains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

%brand% is updated with signed update files. This provides flexibility
in deciding when to upgrade the system with patches, new drivers, or
new features. It also allows "test driving" an upcoming release.
Combined with boot environments, new features or system patches can be
tested while still being able to revert to a previous version of the
operating system (see :ref:`If Something Goes Wrong`). Digital signing
of update files eliminates the need to manually download both an
upgrade file and the associated checksum to verify file integrity.

:numref:`Figure %s <update_options_fig>`
shows an example of the
:menuselection:`System --> Update`
screen.


.. _update_options_fig:

#ifdef freenas
.. figure:: images/system-update1a.png

   Update Options
#endif freenas
#ifdef truenas
.. figure:: images/tn_system-update.png

   Update Options
#endif truenas


By default, the system automatically checks for updates and issues an
alert when a new update becomes available. The automatic check can be
disabled by unchecking :guilabel:`Automatically check for updates`.

This screen lists the URL of the official update server in case that
information is needed in a network with outbound firewall
restrictions. It also shows which software branch, or *train*, is
being tracked for updates.

Several trains are available for updates.

.. caution:: **Only Production trains are recommended for regular
   usage.** Other trains are made available for pre-production testing
   and updates to legacy versions. Pre-production testing trains are
   provided only to permit testing of new versions before switching to
   a new branch. Before using a non-production train, be prepared to
   experience bugs or problems. Testers are encouraged to submit bug
   reports at https://redmine.ixsystems.com/projects/freenas/issues.


These trains are available:

#ifdef freenas
**For Production Use**

* **FreeNAS-11-STABLE** (Recommended)

  After testing, new fixes and features are added to this train.
  Selecting this train and applying any pending updates is
  recommended.

**For Pre-Production Testing**

* **FreeNAS-11-Nightlies: Do not use this train in production**. It
  is the experimental branch for future versions and is meant only for
  testers and developers.


* **FreeNAS-11-Nightlies-SDK: Do not use this train in production**.
  This train is meant only for developers. It is similar to
  *FreeNAS-11-Nightlies* but with extra development and debugging
  utilities added.

* **FreeNAS-HEAD-Nightlies: Do not use this train in production**.
  This train is meant only for developers and contains the source that
  will eventually become %brand% version 12.

**Legacy Versions**

* **FreeNAS-9.10-STABLE**

  Maintenance-only updates to the older version of %brand%. Upgrading
  to FreeNAS-11-STABLE is recommended to ensure that the system
  receives bug fixes and new features.


To change the train, use the drop-down menu to make a different
selection.

.. note:: The train selector does not allow downgrades. For example,
   the STABLE train cannot be selected while booted into a Nightly
   boot environment, or a 9.10 train cannot be selected while booted
   into a 11 boot environment. To go back to an earlier version
   after testing or running a more recent version, reboot and select a
   boot environment for that earlier version. This screen can then be
   used to check for updates that train.


This screen also shows the URL of the official update server. That
information can be required when using a network with outbound
firewall restrictions.
#endif freenas
#ifdef truenas
**For Production Use**

* **TrueNAS-11-STABLE** (Recommended)

  After new fixes and features have been tested as production-ready,
  they are added to this train. Following this train  and applying any
  pending updates from it is recommended.

**Legacy Versions**

* **TrueNAS-9.10-STABLE**

  Maintenance-only updates for the previous branch of %brand%.

* **TrueNAS-9.3-STABLE**

  Maintenance-only updates for the older 9.3 branch of %brand%. Use
  this train only at the recommendation of an iX support engineer.
#endif truenas

The :guilabel:`Verify Install` button verifies that the operating
system files in the current installation do not have any
inconsistencies. If any problems are found, a pop-up menu lists the
files with checksum mismatches or permission errors.


.. Checking for Updates:

Checking for Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#ifdef freenas
Checking for updates by making sure the desired train is selected and
clicking the :guilabel:`Check Now` button. Any available updates are
listed. In the example shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <review_updates_fig>`,
the numbers which begin with a *#* represent the issue number from
`the issue tracker <https://redmine.ixsystems.com/projects/freenas/issues>`__.
Numbers which do not begin with a *#* represent a git commit. Click
the :guilabel:`ChangeLog` link to open the log of changes in a web
browser. Click the :guilabel:`ReleaseNotes` link to open the Release
Notes in the browser.

   Reviewing Updates
#endif freenas

#ifdef truenas
To see if any updates are available, click the :guilabel:`Check Now`
button. Any available updates are listed.
#endif truenas


Applying Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure the system is in a low-usage state as described above in
:ref:`Preparing for Updates`.

Click the :guilabel:`OK` button to download and apply the updates. Be
aware that some updates automatically reboot the system after they are
applied.

.. warning:: Each update creates a boot environment. If the update
   process needs more space, it attempts to remove old boot
   environments. Boot environments marked with the *Keep* attribute as
   shown in :ref:`Boot` will not be removed. If space for a new boot
   environment is not available, the upgrade fails. Space on the boot
   device can be manually freed using
   :menuselection:`System --> Boot`.
   Review the boot environments and remove the *Keep* attribute or
   delete any boot environments that are no longer needed.

Updates can also be downloaded and applied later. To do so, uncheck
the :guilabel:`Apply updates after downloading` box before pressing
:guilabel:`OK`. In this case, this screen closes after updates are
downloaded. Downloaded updates are listed in the
:guilabel:`Pending Updates` section of the screen shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <update_options_fig>`.
When ready to apply the previously downloaded updates, click the
:guilabel:`Apply Pending Updates` button. Remember that the system
might reboot after the updates are applied.

.. warning:: After updates have completed, reboot the system.
   Configuration changes made after an update but before that final
   reboot will not be saved.


Manual Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updates can be manually downloaded as a file. These updates are then
applied with the :guilabel:`Manual Update` button. After obtaining the
update file, click :guilabel:`Manual Update` and choose a location to
temporarily store the file on the %brand% system. Use the file browser
to locate the update file, then click :guilabel:`Apply Update` to
apply it.

Manual update files can be identified by their filenames, which end in
:file:`-manual-update-unsigned.tar`.

Manual updates cannot be used to upgrade from older major versions.


#ifdef truenas
.. _Updating from the CLI:

Updating from the Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updates can also be performed from the :ref:`Shell` with an update
file. Make the update file available by copying it to the %brand%
system, then run the update program, giving it the path to the file:
:samp:`freenas-update {update_file}`.


.. _Updating an HA System:

Updating an HA System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the %brand% array has been configured for High Availability
(HA), the update process must be started on the active node. Once
the update is complete, the standby node will automatically reboot.
Wait for it to come back up by monitoring the remote console or the
graphical administrative interface of the standby node.

After the standby node has finished booting, it is important to
perform a failover by rebooting the current active node. This action
tells the standby node to import the current configuration and restart
services.

Once the previously active node comes back up as a standby node, use
:menuselection:`System --> Update`
to apply the update on the current active node (which was
previously the passive node). Once complete, the now standby node

.. index:: Alert Services
.. _Alert Services:

Alert Services
--------------

%brand% can use a number of methods to notify the administrator of
system events that require attention. These events are system
:ref:`Alerts <Alert>` marked *WARN* or *CRITICAL*.

Currently available alert services:

* `AWS-SNS <https://aws.amazon.com/sns/>`__

* `Hipchat <https://www.atlassian.com/software/hipchat>`__

* `InfluxDB <https://www.influxdata.com/>`__

* `Slack <https://slack.com/>`__

* `Mattermost <https://about.mattermost.com/>`__

* `OpsGenie <https://www.opsgenie.com/>`__

* `PagerDuty <https://www.pagerduty.com/>`__

* `VictorOps <https://victorops.com/>`__


.. warning:: These alert services might use a third party commercial
   vendor not directly affiliated with iXsystems. Please investigate
   and fully understand that vendor's pricing policies and services
   before using their alert service. iXsystems is not responsible for
   any charges incurred from the use of third party vendors with the
   Alert Services feature.


Select
:menuselection:`System --> Alert Services` to go to the Alert Services
screen. Click :guilabel:`Add Service` to display the dialog shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <alertservices_add_fig>`.


.. _alertservices_add_fig:

.. figure:: images/system-alertservices-add.png

   Add Alert Service


The :guilabel:`Service Name` drop-down menu is used to pick a specific
alert service. The fields shown in the rest of the dialog change to
those required by that service. Enter the required information, check
the :guilabel:`Enabled` checkbox, then click :guilabel:`OK` to save
the settings.

System alerts marked *WARN* or *CRITICAL* are sent to each alert
service that has been configured and enabled.

Alert services can be deleted from this list by clicking them and then
clicking the :guilabel:`Delete` button at the bottom of the window. To
disable an alert service temporarily, click :guilabel:`Edit` and
remove the checkmark from the :guilabel:`Enabled` checkbox.

.. note:: To send a test alert, highlight an alert entry, click
   :guilabel:`Edit`, and click the :guilabel:`Send Test Alert` button.

How it Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A *nas-health* service is registered with Consul. This service runs
:file:`/usr/local/etc/consul-checks/freenas_health.sh` periodically,
currently every two minutes. If an alert marked *WARNING* or
*CRITICAL* is found, the *nas-health* service is marked as
"unhealthy", triggering :command:`consul-alerts` to notify configured
alert services.


.. index:: CA, Certificate Authority
.. _CAs:

CAs
---

%brand% can act as a Certificate Authority (CA). When encrypting SSL
or TLS connections to the %brand% system, either import an existing
certificate, or create a CA on the %brand% system, then create a
certificate. This certificate will appear in the drop-down menus for
services that support SSL or TLS.

For secure LDAP, the public key of an existing CA can be imported with
:guilabel:`Import CA`, or a new CA created on the %brand% system and
used on the LDAP server also.

:numref:`Figure %s <cas_fig>`
shows the screen after clicking
:menuselection:`System --> CAs`.

To instead create an intermediate CA which is part of a certificate
chain, click the :guilabel:`Create Intermediate CA` button. This
screen adds one more option to the screen shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <create_ca_fig>`:

* **Signing Certificate Authority:** this drop-down menu is used to
  specify the root CA in the certificate chain. This CA must first be
  imported or created.

Any CAs that you import or create will be added as entries in
:menuselection:`System --> CAs`.
The columns in this screen indicate the name of the CA, whether it is
an internal CA, whether the issuer is self-signed, the number of
certificates that have been issued by the CA, the distinguished name
of the CA, the date and time the CA was created, and the date and time
the CA expires.

Clicking the entry for a CA causes these buttons to become available:

* **Sign CSR:** used to sign internal Certificate Signing Requests created
  using
  :menuselection:`System --> Certificates --> Create Certificate Signing Request`.

* **Export Certificate:** prompts to browse to the location to save a
  copy of the CA's X.509 certificate on the computer being used to
  access the %brand% system.

* **Export Private Key:** prompts to browse to the location to save a
  copy of the CA's private key on the computer being used to access
  the %brand% system. This option only appears if the CA has a private
  key.

* **Delete:** prompts for confirmation before deleting the CA.

On %brand% :ref:`High Availability (HA) <Failover>` systems, the
imported certificate must include the IP addresses or DNS hostnames of
both nodes and the CARP virtual IP address. These IP addresses or DNS
hostnames can be placed in the :guilabel:`Subject Alternative Name`
(SAN) x509 extension field.

If you need to use a certificate that is signed by an external CA,
such as Verisign, instead create a certificate signing request. To do
so, click :guilabel:`Create Certificate Signing Request`.
A screen like the one in
:numref:`Figure %s <create_new_cert_fig>` opens,
but without the :guilabel:`Signing Certificate Authority` field.

Certificates that are imported, self-signed, or for which a
certificate signing request is created are added as entries to
:menuselection:`System --> Certificates`.
In the example shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <manage_cert_fig>`,
a self-signed certificate and a certificate signing request have been
created for the fictional organization *My Company*. The self-signed
certificate was issued by the internal CA named *My Company* and the
administrator has not yet sent the certificate signing request to
Verisign so that it can be signed. Once that certificate is signed
and returned by the external CA, it should be imported using
:guilabel:`Import Certificate` so it is available as a
configurable option for encrypting connections.

  :guilabel:`Certificate`, and :guilabel:`Private Key`.

* **Export Certificate** saves a copy of the certificate or
  certificate signing request to the system being used to access the
  %brand% system. For a certificate signing request, send the
  exported certificate to the external signing authority so that it
  can be signed.

* **Export Private Key** saves a copy of the private key associated
  with the certificate or certificate signing request to the system
  being used to access the %brand% system.

* **Delete** is used to delete a certificate or certificate signing
  request.

This screen provides a built-in interface to the %brand% issue
tracker located at
https://redmine.ixsystems.com/projects/freenas/issues.
If you have not yet used the %brand% bug tracker, you must first go
to that website, click the :guilabel:`Register` link, fill out the
form, and reply to the registration email. This will create a username
and password which can be used to create bug reports and receive
notifications as the reports are actioned.

Before creating a bug report or feature request, ensure that an
existing report does not already exist at
https://redmine.ixsystems.com/projects/freenas/issues.
If you find a similar issue that is not yet marked as *closed* or
*resolved*, add a comment to that issue if you have new information
to provide that can assist in resolving the issue. If you find a
similar issue that is marked as *closed* or *resolved*, you can
create a new issue and refer to the earlier issue number.

.. note:: If you are not updated to the latest version of STABLE,
   do that first to see if it resolves your issue.

To generate a report using the built-in :guilabel:`Support` screen,
complete the following fields:

* **Username:** enter the login name created when registering at
  https://redmine.ixsystems.com/projects/freenas/issues.

* **Password:** enter the password associated with the registered
  login name.

* **Type:** select *Bug* when reporting an issue or *Feature* when
  requesting a new feature.

* **Category:** this drop-down menu is empty until a registered
  :guilabel:`Username` and :guilabel:`Password` are entered. An error
  message is displayed if either value is incorrect. After the
  :guilabel:`Username` and :guilabel:`Password` are
  validated, possible categories are populated to the drop-down menu.
  Select the one that best describes the bug or feature being
  reported.

* **Attach Debug Info:** it is recommended to leave this box
  checked so that an overview of the system's hardware, build
  string, and configuration is automatically generated and included
  with the ticket.  Generating and attaching a debug to the ticket can
  take some time.

* **Subject:** enter a descriptive title for the ticket. A good
  *Subject* makes it easy for you and other users to find similar
  reports.

* **Description:** enter a one- to three-paragraph summary of the
  issue that describes the problem, and if applicable, what steps can
  be taken to reproduce it.

* **Attachments:** this is the only optional field. It is useful
  for including configuration files or screenshots of any errors or
  tracebacks.

Once you have finished completing the fields, click the
:guilabel:`Submit` button to automatically generate and upload the
report to https://redmine.ixsystems.com/projects/freenas/issues.
A pop-up menu provides a clickable URL so to view status or add
additional information to the report.

.. index:: Failover

.. _Failover:

Failover
--------

If the %brand% array has been licensed for High Availability (HA),
a :guilabel:`Failover` tab is added to :guilabel:`System`.

%brand% uses an active/standby configuration of dual storage
controllers for HA. Dual-ported disk drives are connected to both
storage controllers simultaneously. One storage controller is active,
the other standby. The active controller sends periodic announcements
to the network. If a fault occurs and the active controller stops
sending the announcements, the standby controller detects this and
initiates a failover. Storage and cache devices are imported on the
standby controller, then I/O operations switch to over to it. The standby
controller then becomes the active controller. This failover operation can happen in
seconds rather than the minutes of other configurations, significantly
reducing the chance of a client timeout.

The Common Address Redundancy Protocol
(`CARP <http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/carp.html>`__)
is used to provide high availability and failover. CARP was originally
developed by the OpenBSD project and provides an open source, non
patent-encumbered alternative to the VRRP and HSRP protocols.


.. warning:: Seamless failover is only available with iSCSI or NFSv4.
   Other protocols will failover, but connections will be disrupted
   by the failover event.


To configure HA, turn on both units in the array. Use the
instructions in the :ref:`Console Setup Menu` to log into the
graphical interface for one of the units (it does not matter which
one). If this is the first login, the :guilabel:`Upload License`
screen is automatically displayed. Otherwise, click
:menuselection:`System --> Support --> Upload License`.

Paste the HA license received from iXsystems and press :guilabel:`OK`
to activate it. The license contains the serial numbers for both units
in the chassis. After the license is activated, the
:guilabel:`Failover` tab is added to :guilabel:`System` and some
fields are modified in :guilabel:`Network` so that the peer IP
address, peer hostname, and virtual IP can be configured. An extra
:guilabel:`IPMI (Node A/B)` tab will also be added so that
:ref:`IPMI` can be configured for the other unit.


.. note:: The modified fields refer to this node as *This Node* and
   the other node as either *A* or *B*. The node value is hard-coded
   into each unit and the value that appears is automatically
   generated. For example, on node *A*, the fields refer to node *B*,
   and vice versa.


To configure HA networking, go to
:menuselection:`Network --> Global Configuration`.
The :guilabel:`Hostname` field is replaced by two fields:

* **Hostname (Node A/B):** enter the hostname to use for the other
  node.

* **Hostname (This Node):** enter the hostname to use for this
  node.

Next, go to
:menuselection:`Network --> Interfaces --> Add Interface`.
The HA license adds several fields to the usual :ref:`Interfaces`
screen:

* **IPv4 Address (Node A/B):** if the other node will use a static
  IP address, rather than DHCP, set it here.

* **IPv4 Address (This Node):** if this node will use a static IP
  address, rather than DHCP, set it here.

* **Virtual IP:** enter the IP address to use for administrative
  access to the array.

* **Virtual Host ID:** the Virtual Host ID (VHID) must be unique on
  the broadcast segment of the network. It can be any unused number
  between *1* and *255*.

* **Critical for Failover:** check this box if a failover should
  occur when this interface becomes unavailable. How many seconds
  it takes for that failover to occur depends upon the value of the
  :guilabel:`Timeout`, as described in
  :numref:`Table %s <failover_opts_tab>`.
  This checkbox is interface-specific, allowing you to have different
  settings for a management network and a data network. Note that
  checking this box requires the *Virtual IP* to be set and that at
  least one interface needs to be set as
  :guilabel:`Critical for Failover` to configure failover.

* **Group:** this drop-down menu is grayed out unless the
  :guilabel:`Critical for Failover` checkbox is checked. This box
  allows grouping multiple, critical-for-failover interfaces. In this
  case, all of the interfaces in a group must go down before
  failover occurs. This can be a useful configuration in a
  multipath scenario.

After the network configuration is complete, log out and log back in,
this time using the :guilabel:`Virtual IP` address. Volumes and shares
can now be configured as usual and configuration automatically
synchronizes between the active and the standby node.

The passive or standby node indicates the virtual IP address that is
used for configuration management. The standby node also has a red
:guilabel:`Standby` icon and no longer accepts logins as all
configuration changes must occur on the active node.


.. note:: After the :guilabel:`Virtual IP` address is configured, all
   subsequent logins should use that address.

After HA has been configured, an :guilabel:`HA Enabled` icon is shown
to the right of the :guilabel:`Alert` icon on the active node.

When HA has been disabled by the system administrator, the status icon
changes to :guilabel:`HA Disabled`. If the standby node is not
available because it is powered off, still starting up, or is
disconnected from the network, or if failover has not been configured,
the status icon changes to :guilabel:`HA Unavailable`.

The icon is red when HA is starting up, disabled, or has encountered a
problem. When HA is functioning normally, the icon turns green.

The options available in
:menuselection:`System --> Failover`
are shown in
:numref:`Figure %s: <failover_fig>`
and described in
:numref:`Table %s <failover_opts_tab>`.

.. warning:: Booting an HA pair with failover disabled causes both
   nodes to come up in standby mode. The GUI shows an additional
   :guilabel:`Force Takeover` button which can be used to force that
