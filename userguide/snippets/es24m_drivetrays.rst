Install Drive Trays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array. Drive trays are
installed in drive bays in the chassis. Each drive bay in the chassis
has two indicator LEDs to the right of the tray. The status LED is
blue when the drive is active, and the fault LED is red if a fault has
occurred.

Press the silver button on the drive tray to open the latch. Carefully
slide the tray into a drive bay until the right side of the latch
touches the metal front edge of the chassis, then gently swing the
latch closed until it clicks into place.
