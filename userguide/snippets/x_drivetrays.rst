Install Drive Trays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array. Each drive tray has
a status LED which is blue when active or amber if a fault has
occurred.

Recommended drive tray installation order: first, SSD drives for SLOG
(if present), then SSD drives for L2ARC (if present), followed by hard
drives. Install the first drive tray in the upper-left drive bay.
Install the next drive tray to the right of the first. Continue
installing remaining drive trays to the right, across the row. After a
row is filled with drives, move down to the next row and start again
with the leftmost bay. This order is strongly recommended as it
simplifies support.

Press the blue button to open the latch. Carefully slide the tray into
a drive bay until the left side of the latch touches the metal front
edge of the chassis. Gently swing the latch closed until it clicks into
place.
