.. index:: Attach E16 Expansion Shelf Inner Rail to Chassis

To attach the E16 expansion shelf inner rail to the chassis, remove
the inner rail from both rails. Slide the inner and outer rails
apart, and then push the pin-lock latch outward to allow the rails
to separate completely, as shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <appliance15>`.

   Separate Inner and Outer Rails


Align the inner rail keyholes to the two hooks near the front of
the chassis, then slide the rails forward into place as shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <appliance16>`.

   Attach Inner Rail to Chassis


Secure the inner rail in place with a small screw from the rail
kit. Refer to

   Secure Inner Rail in Place


The %brand% E16 expansion shelf slide rails support racks with both
square and circular hole types. Set the mounting brackets into the
correct position for the type of rack by pressing the button on the
mounting bracket and rotating them in place, as shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <appliance18>`.
The square rack style brackets are the default. The circular hole
style is the one with a flat surface and screw holes.

   Rotate Rackmount Bracket


Before installing, confirm that the rails included with the %brand%
E16 expansion shelf are long enough for the rack being used. Examine
each rail to find the sides labeled *Front* and *Rear*.

For racks with square holes, snap the mounting brackets into the
holes at either end of the rail into the mouting holes. Make sure
to install the rails with the end labeled *Front* toward the front
of the rack. Refer to
:numref:`Figure %s <appliance19>` for a detailed view.

   Installing Rails in Racks with Square Holes


For racks with round holes, secure the rails into the rack at the
desired position using the eight thumbscrews included with the
rails. Make sure to install the rails with the end labeled *Front*
toward the front of the rack. Refer to
:numref:`Figure %s <appliance20>`
for a detailed view.

   Installing Rails in Racks with Round Holes


The E16 expansion shelf can now be installed in the rack.

.. warning:: Two people are required to lift a %brand% E16
   expansion shelf.

Carefully align the %brand% E16 expansion shelf inner rail with the
notches in the outer rail. When the rails are aligned, slide the
array toward the rack. When the array stops moving, move the
pin-lock laches to allow the array to slide the rest of the way
into the rack. Refer to
:numref:`Figure %s <appliance21>`
for a detailed view.

expansion shelf as shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <appliance22>`.

   E16 expansion shelf before racking.

   Drive Installation Instructions


.. index:: Connect E16 Expansion Shelf to TrueNAS Array

Note the labels on the SAS ports on the back of the %brand% Storage
Array and the letter label on the back of the expansion shelf.
Using the included SAS cables, connect the *In* SAS port of the top
expander on the E16 expansion shelf to the SAS port with the same
letter on the %brand% Storage Array's primary storage controller
(the one in the top slot). If a secondary storage controller has been
installed, connect the *In* SAS port of the bottom expander to the
port with the same letter on the secondary storage controller.
Refer to
:numref:`Figure %s <appliance24>` for a detailed view.
