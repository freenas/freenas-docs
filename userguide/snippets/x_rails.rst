Rail Kit Assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On racks that are 30 inches deep or less, proceed to rail spring
installation below.

Racks from 31 to 36 inches deep require installation of the included
rail extenders. For these deeper racks, install cage nuts on the
outside rear of the rack.
**The tabs on the cage nuts must be horizontal as shown**.
Using the included bolts, install the rail extender inside the rear of
the rack. Repeat the process for the second extender, which is a
mirror image of the first.

If not already present, install a spring on the silver posts in the
side of each rail.

Open the clamp latches on the ends of each rail. Place the rail in the
rack with the front end toward the front of the rack, aligning the
pins on both ends of the rail with the mounting holes in the rack.
Swing the clamp latch closed to hold the rail in place. Use two of the
supplied screws to secure the back end of the rail in place. Repeat
the process for the second rail.

**Caution: Two people are required to safely lift the chassis for rack
installation or removal.** Do not install drives until after the
chassis has been installed in the rack, and remove all drives before
removing the chassis from the rack.

Carefully place the chassis onto the rails mounted in the rack. Push
the chassis in until the ears are flush with the front of the rack.
Use two of the supplied screws to secure each ear to the rack.
