Become Familiar With the System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ES12 has front panel indicators for power, unit identify and
fault. The Fault indicator is on during the initial power-on self-test
(POST) or when the %brand% software has issued an
`alert
<https://support.ixsystems.com/truenasguide/tn_options.html#alert>`__.

.. index:: Rail Kit Assembly

Rail Kit Assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Mount the Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install a spring on the silver posts in the side of each rail.

.. _es12_spring:
.. figure:: images/tn_x10es12_spring.png
   :width: 50%

   Installing Rail Springs


Open the clamp latches on the ends of each rail. Place the rail in the
rack with the front end toward the front of the rack, aligning the
pins on both ends of the rail with the mounting holes in the rack.
Swing the clamp latch closed to hold the rail in place. Use two of the
supplied screws to secure the back end of the rail in place. Repeat
the process for the second rail.

   Rail Clamp Latch


Mount the Unit in the Rack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Caution: Two people are required to safely lift the chassis for rack
installation or removal.** Do not install drives until after the
chassis has been installed in the rack, and remove all drives before
removing the chassis from the rack.

Snap the black bezel mounting ears onto the metal ES12 chassis ears.
Carefully place the ES12 chassis onto the rails mounted in the rack.
Push the ES12 chassis in until the ears are flush with the front of
the rack.  Use two of the supplied screws to secure each ear to the
rack.

Install Drive Trays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array. Each drive tray has
a status LED which is blue when active or amber if a fault has
occurred.

Press the blue button to open the latch. Carefully slide the tray into
a drive bay until the left side of the latch touches the metal front
edge of the chassis, then gently swing the latch closed until it
clicks into place.

   Installing Drive Trays


Connect Power Cords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Do not plug the power cords into a power outlet yet.** Connect a
power cord to the back of one power supply, pressing it into the
plastic clamp and pressing on the tab to lock it in place. Repeat the
process for the second power supply and cord.

   \newpage


Connect SAS Cables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shut down and power off the X10. Remove the X10 power cables from the
power outlets.

Plug the ES12 power cords into power outlets.
**Wait two minutes for the drives to start.**

Connect an SAS cable from the T1 connector on the ES12 expander
module 1 to SAS port 1 on the X10 node 1. This is the red line shown
in
:numref:`Figure %s <es12_sasconnect1>`.

If the X10 has a second node for HA (High Availability), connect the
second SAS cable from the T1 connector on the ES12 expander module 2
to SAS port 1 on the X10 node 2. This is the blue line shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <es12_sasconnect1>`.

   SAS Cable Connection for One ES12


.. raw:: latex

   \newpage


A second ES12 can be connected to the X10. After connecting the first
ES12 as shown above, connect an SAS cable from the T1 connector on the
second ES12 expander module 1 to SAS port 2 on the X10 node 1. This is
the dark red line shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <es12_sasconnect2>`.

If the X10 has a second node for HA (High Availability), connect the
second SAS cable from the T1 connector on the second ES12 expander
module 2 to SAS port 2 on the X10 node 2. This is the dark blue line
shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <es12_sasconnect2>`.

   SAS Cable Connection for Two ES12s


After all SAS cables have been connected, plug the X10 power cords
into power outlets.


Install Bezel (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included bezel is not required for operation. If desired, install
the bezel by aligning it with the pins on the bezel ears and pressing
it into place.
