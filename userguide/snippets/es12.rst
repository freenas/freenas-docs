The ES12 has front panel indicators for power, locate ID, and
fault. The fault indicator is on during the initial power-on self-test
(POST) or when the %brand% software has issued an
`alert
<https://support.ixsystems.com/truenasguide/tn_options.html#alert>`__.

Install Drive Trays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array. Each drive tray has
a status LED which is blue when active or amber if a fault has
occurred.

Press the blue button to open the latch. Carefully slide the tray into
a drive bay until the left side of the latch touches the metal front
edge of the chassis, then gently swing the latch closed until it
clicks into place.

   Installing Drive Trays


Connect Power Cords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Do not plug the power cords into a power outlet yet.**
Connect a power cord to the back of one power supply, pressing it into
the plastic clamp and pressing on the tab to lock it in place. Repeat
the process for the second power supply and cord.

   \newpage


Connect SAS Cables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shut down and power off the X series. Remove the X series power cables
from the power outlets.

Plug the ES12 power cords into power outlets.
**Wait two minutes for the drives to start.**

Plug one end of the SAS cable into the T1 connector on the ES12's
expander module 1. Plug the other end into the SAS 1 connector on
the X series node 1. See cable #1 in
:numref:`Figure %s <es12_sasconnect1>`.

If the X series has a second node for HA (High Availability), plug one
end of the second SAS cable into the T1 connector of the ES12's
expander module 2. Plug the other end into the SAS 1 connector on the
X series node 2. See cable #2 in
:numref:`Figure %s <es12_sasconnect1>`.

   \newpage


A second ES12 can also be connected to the X series. After connecting
the first ES12 as shown above, plug one end of an SAS cable into the
T1 connector on the second ES12's expander module 1. Plug the other
end into the SAS 2 connector on the X series node 1. See cable #3 in
:numref:`Figure %s <es12_sasconnect2>`.

If the X10 has a second node for HA (High Availability), plug one end
of an SAS cable into the T1 connector of the second ES12's expander
module 2. Plug the other end into the X series node 2, SAS 2
connector. See cable #4 in
:numref:`Figure %s <es12_sasconnect2>`.

   SAS Cable Connection for Two ES12s


After all SAS cables have been connected, plug the X series power
cords into power outlets.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included bezel is not required for operation. If desired, install
the bezel by aligning it with the pins on the bezel ears and pressing
it into place.
