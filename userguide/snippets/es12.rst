Become Familiar With the ES12 System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ES12 has front panel indicators for power, locate ID, and fault.
The fault indicator is on during the initial power-on self-test (POST)
and turns off during normal operation. It turns on if the %brand%
software issues an
`alert
<https://support.ixsystems.com/truenasguide/tn_options.html#alert>`__.

The ES12 contains two expansion modules in a side-by-side
configuration. The connectors and features on each module are:

Connect SAS Cables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ES12 is compatible with a variety of iXsystems products. The general
procedure to connect SAS cables is the same for each, but a variety of
wiring diagrams are provided to assist in the connection process.

.. update these instructions with the correct procedure: talk to Caleb or Bill

Shut down and power off the %brand% unit. Remove the unit power cables
from the power outlets.

Plug the ES12 power cords into power outlets.
**Wait two minutes for the drives to start.**

Connect SAS cables as shown in the diagrams for each %brand% unit.

After all SAS cables have been connected to the %brand% unit, plug the
power cords back into power outlets.

.. Combine images for each product into one master image that shows two
   ES shelves connected to the unit. Use dotted lines for the second ES
   to show it is optional.

**%brand% X Series**


Connect an SAS cable from the ES12 expansion controller 1 T1 connector
to the X series storage controller 1 SAS 1 connector (cable #1 in photo).

If the X series has a second storage controller for HA (High
Availability), connect a second SAS cable from the ES12 expansion
controller 2 to the X series storage controller 2 SAS 1 connector (cable
#2 in photo).

.. _es12_sasconnect1:
.. figure:: images/truenas/es12_xseries_sasconnect1.png
   :width: 50%


A second ES12 can also be connected to the X series. Connect the first
ES12 as shown above. Then connect the second ES12, running SAS cables
from the ES12 T1 connectors to the SAS 2 connectors on the X series.

.. _es12_sasconnect2:
.. figure:: images/truenas/es12_xseries_sasconnect2.png
   :width: 50%


**%brand% M40**


Connect an SAS cable from the ES12 expansion controller 1 T1 connector
to the M40 series storage controller 1 SAS 1 connector (cable #1 in
photo).

If the M40 has a second storage controller for HA (High Availability),
connect a second SAS cable from the ES12 expansion controller 2 to the
M40 storage controller 2 SAS 1 connector (cable #2 in photo).

.. _es12_sasconnect3:
.. figure:: images/truenas/es12_m40_sasconnect1.png
   :width: 50%


A second ES12 can also be connected to the M40. Connect the first ES12
as shown above. Then connect the second ES12, running SAS cables from
the ES12 T1 connectors to the SAS 2 connectors on the M40.

.. _es12_sasconnect4:

   :width: 50%


**%brand% M50**


The %brand% M50 supports connections with as many as 12 different
expansion shelves. The procedure is similar for each connection, so only
the first two are demonstrated here.

Connect an SAS cable from the ES12 expansion controller 1 T1 connector
to the M50 series storage controller 1 SAS 1 connector (cable #1 in
photo).

If the M50 has a second storage controller for HA (High Availability),
connect a second SAS cable from the ES12 expansion controller 2 to the
M50 storage controller 2 SAS 1 connector (cable #2 in photo).

.. _es12_sasconnect3:
.. figure:: images/truenas/es12_m50_sasconnect1.png
   :width: 50%


A second ES12 can also be connected to the M50. Connect the first ES12
as shown above. Then connect the second ES12, running SAS cables from
the ES12 T1 connectors to the SAS 2 connectors on the M50.

Install Bezel (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included bezel is not required for operation. If desired, install
the bezel by aligning it with the pins on the bezel ears and pressing
it into place.
