Become Familiar With the ES60
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ES60 has indicators on the front panel for power, fault, and
locate ID. The fault indicator is on during the initial power-on
self-test (POST) or when the %brand% software has issued an
`alert
<https://support.ixsystems.com/truenasguide/tn_options.html#alert>`__.

Rail Kit Assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Separate Cabinet Rails from Rack Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each rack rail includes an inner cabinet rail that must be removed.
Extend the cabinet rail until the white release tab is exposed.

.. figure:: images/tn_es60_rail_separate.png


Press the white release tab to the right while pulling the cabinet
rail to remove it. Repeat this process for the second rail.


Mount Cabinet Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cabinet rails are mounted on each side of the system. Align the
cabinet rail keyholes with the posts on the side of the chassis. Slide
the rail toward the rear of the system until the metal tab clicks and
secures the rail in place. Repeat this process on the other side.

.. figure:: images/tn_es60_cabinetrails.png


Mount Rack Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install four cage nuts in the rack, one for each bracket. The lock
screw for the bracket is already installed in the cage nut. Place the
rail in the rack with the front end toward the front of the rack and
rear toward the back of the rack, aligning the pins on both ends of
the rail with the mounting holes in the rack. Push the pins into the
rack holes until they lock in place.

.. figure:: images/tn_es60_rackrails.png


Mount Unit in the Rack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. caution:: The unit weighs about 80 pounds.
   At least two people are required to safely lift the
   chassis for rack installation or removal. This process
   should not be attempted alone as it involves risks and
   could result in equipment damage or personal injury.

Do not install drives until after the chassis has been installed in
the rack, and remove all drives before removing the chassis
from the rack.

Slide the front rack rail forward to meet the rear of the cabinet
rails. Align the cabinet rail with the inside of the front rack rail
and slide the cabinet rail forward until it is fully seated inside the
rack rail. Repeat the process for the second rail.

.. figure:: images/tn_es60_cabinet_mount.png


When both cabinet rails are secured inside the rack rails, carefully
slide the chassis until the ears are flush with the front of the rack.
Turn both blue screws on the ears of the chassis to the right to
secure the unit in the rack.

.. figure:: images/tn_es60_cabinet_secure.png


Drive Tray Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. note:: Do not install the drives until the chassis has been
   installed in the rack.


Remove Top Cover
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Slide the unit out on the rails. Turn the blue screws counterclockwise
to unlock the top cover. Slide the top cover toward the front of the
system, then lift to remove it.

.. figure:: images/tn_es60_remove_cover.png


Install Drive Trays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array.

A standard drive tray installation order simplifies support and is
strongly recommended:

* SSD drives for SLOG, if present

* SSD drives for L2ARC, if present

* Hard drives or SSD drives for data storage

Install the first drive tray in the front left drive bay. Install the
next drive tray to the right of the first. Install remaining drive
trays to the right across the row. After a row is filled with drives,
move back to the next row and start again with the left bay. A label
on the front left of the lid identifies the preferred order of drive
connection.

Press the blue button to open the latch. Lower the drive tray into a
drive bay until the latch begins to move into place. Push the latch
the rest of the way until it locks into place.

ES60 Cable Management Arm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included cable management arm (CMA) is not required for operation.
If desired, the CMA can be used to help organize the ES60 power and
data cables.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_parts.png


The tabs along the side of the flex housing can be unclipped from the
top, the bottom, or removed entirely.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_tabs.png
   :width: 20%


Install the Cable Management Arm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Locate the two posts on the left rear side of the ES60. Align the
holes on the CMA chassis bracket with the posts on the chassis. Slide
the cable management arm forward and pull the lever on the latch
upward to lock the bracket into place.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_clip.png


Locate the end of the flex housing with exposed pins. Unclip and open
the two tabs closest to the end, allowing the flex housing to compress
enough to fit into the bracket holes. Press the flex housing firmly
into the bracket until the pins seat in the holes.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_chassis_flex.png


Remove the two screws already attached to the side of the CMA rail
bracket. Align the screw holes with the holes in the rear of the left
cabinet rail and attach the bracket to the rail with the screws.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_bracket_rail.png
   :width: 40%


Locate the end of the flex housing with exposed holes. Unclip and open
the two tabs closest to the end, allowing the flex housing to expand
enough to fit over the bracket pins. Press the flex housing firmly
into the bracket until the holes seat on the pins.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_rail_flex.png

   \newpage


Completed Cable Management Arm assembly:


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_arm_complete.png
   :width: 80%


Power and data cables are routed through the flex housing. The tabs
can be opened or removed to allow access or space for cable ends.
Remember to leave some slack in the cables at both ends to allow for
movement of the arm and chassis.


Connect Power Cords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Do not plug the power cords into a power outlet yet.** Connect a
power cord to the back of one power supply, pressing it into the
plastic clamp and pressing on the tab to lock it in place. Repeat the
process for the second power supply and cord. This turns on the ES60.


.. figure:: images/tn_es60_powerclip.png
   :width: 50%


.. note:: Service and management ports are not used during normal
   operation and should not be connected.


When setting up an ES60 for the first time, wait two minutes after
turning on the ES60 before powering on the %brand% Unified Array. If
the %brand% Unified Array is already in operation, the Expansion Shelf
can be powered on at any time.


Connect SAS Cables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plug the ES60 power cords into power outlets.
**Wait two minutes for the drives to start.**


.. note:: The %brand% Unified Array can remain on while the expansion
   shelf is connected.


Connecting the ES60 to a %brand% X20
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Connect an SAS cable from the ES60 expansion controller 1 connector 1 to
the X20 1 SAS 1 connector (cable #1 in photo). If the X20 has a second
storage controller for HA (High Availability), connect a second SAS
cable from the ES60 expansion controller 2 connector 1 to the X20 storage
controller 2 SAS 1 connector (cable #2 in photo).


.. _es60_x20sasconnect1:
.. figure:: images/tn_es60_sasconnect1.png
   :width: 50%


Connecting the ES60 to a %brand% Z35
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Connect an SAS cable from the ES60 expansion controller 1 connector 1 to
the Z35 Controller 1 SAS 1 connector (cable #1 in photo). If the Z35
has a second storage controller for HA (High Availability), connect a
second SAS cable from the ES60 expansion controller 2 connector 1 to the Z35
Controller 2 SAS 1 connector (cable #2 in photo).


.. _es60_zsasconnect1:
.. figure:: images/tn_es60_zsasconnect1.png
   :width: 50%


A second ES60 can also be connected to the Z35. Connect the first
ES60 as shown above. Then connect the second ES60 1 ports to the
next unused SAS ports on the Z35 as shown:


.. _es60_zsasconnect2:
.. figure:: images/tn_es60_zsasconnect2.png
   :width: 50%


Up to eight ES60 expansion shelves are supported on the %brand% Z35.


Install Bezel (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included bezel is not required for operation.

Line up the screw holes on the back of the bezel with the screw holes
on the ears of the ES60. Install one upper screw from the back side of
the left ES60 ear, then install a lower screw from the back of the
right ES60 ear. Install the remaining two screws following the same
diagonal pattern.
