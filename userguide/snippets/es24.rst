Become Familiar With the ES24
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ES24 has front panel buttons for power and alarm mute, and
indicators for power, locate ID, and fault. The fault indicator is on
during the initial power-on self-test (POST) or when the %brand%
software has issued an
`alert
<https://support.ixsystems.com/truenasguide/tn_options.html#alert>`__.

.. index:: Rail Kit Assembly

Rail Kit Assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remove Cabinet Rails from Rack Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Extend the cabinet rail until it stops. To remove the cabinet rail,
press the white release tab to the right while pulling the cabinet
rail.

.. _cabinet_rail_removal:
.. figure:: images/tn_es24_cabinet_rail1.png


Mount Cabinet Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cabinet rails are mounted on both sides of the system. Align the
cabinet rail keyhole with the post on the side of the chassis and pull
the rail until the post is wedged in the smaller hole.


.. _cabinet_rail2:
.. image:: images/tn_es24_cabinet_rail2.png


Align the rail holes with the screw holes and secure the rail with
three of the supplied cabinet screws included with the rail kit.
Repeat this process on the other side.

.. _rail_screws:
.. figure:: images/tn_es24_rail_screws.png
   :width: 15%


Mount the Rack Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Place the rail in the rack with the front end toward the front of the
rack, aligning the pins with the mounting holes in the front rack.
Push the pins in the holes until the latch clicks. Secure rail in
place with the front rail screw included in the rail kit. Repeat this
process for the second front rail.

Install two square cage nuts on the front end of the rack, one
directly above the top rail pin and the other in the third rack hole
above it. Repeat this process on the other front rail. The cage nuts
will later support the screws used to secure the enclosure to the
rack.

For the rear end of the rail, align the pins with the mounting holes
on the rear rack. Pull the white latch toward the rear until the pins
click in place. Repeat this process for the second rear rail.


.. _rack_rail_install:
.. figure:: images/tn_es24_rack_rail_install.png
   :width: 60%


Mount the Unit in the Rack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Caution: Two people are required to safely lift the chassis for rack
installation or removal.** Do not install drives until after the
chassis has been installed in the rack, and remove all drives before
removing the chassis from the rack.

Pull the front rack rail forward until it stops. Align the cabinet
rail with the inside of the front rack rail and slide the cabinet rail
forward until it is fully seated inside the rack rail. Repeat the
process for the second rail.


.. _rack_rail_to_cabinet_rail:
.. figure:: images/tn_es24_cabinet_meets_rack.png
   :width: 60%


When both cabinet rails are secured inside of the rack rails, gently
push the chassis until it stops halfway in. Slide the blue release
tabs on both cabinet rails toward the front of the system while
pushing the unit in until it is flush with the front of the rack.


.. _mount_system_in_rack:
.. figure:: images/tn_es24_mount_system.png
   :width: 60%


Anchor the unit in the rack on both sides with the 6-32 screws
included in the rail kit.


.. _secure_system_in_rack:
.. figure:: images/tn_es24_secure_unit.png
   :width: 50%


Install Drive Trays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drive trays are used to mount drives in the array. Each drive tray has
a status LED which is blue when active or amber if a fault has
occurred.

Press the silver button to open the latch. Carefully slide the tray
into a drive bay until the right side of the latch touches the metal
front edge of the chassis, then gently swing the latch closed until it
clicks into place.


.. _drive_installation:
.. figure:: images/tn_es24_drive_tray1.png
   :width: 60%


Connect Power Cords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Do not plug the power cords into a power outlet yet.**
Connect a power cord to the back of one power supply. Place the cord
into the plastic clamp and press the tab into the latch to lock it in
place. Repeat the process for the second power supply and cord.

.. _power_cord_connection:
.. figure:: images/tn_es24_power_cord.png
  :width: 35%


Connect SAS Cables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shut down and power off the %brand% Z series. Remove the Z series
power cables from the power outlets.

Plug the ES24 power cords into power outlets.
**Wait two minutes for the drives to start.**

Connect an SAS cable from ES24 expansion module 1 SAS 0 connector to
the farthest left Z series node 1 SAS connector (cable #1 in photo).

If the Z series has a second node for HA (High Availability), connect
a second SAS cable from ES24 expansion module 2 SAS 0 connector to the
farthest left Z series node 2 SAS connector (cable #2 in photo).


.. _es24_sasconnect1:

   :width: 50%

   SAS Cable Connection for One ES24


A second ES24 can also be connected to the Z series. Connect the first
ES24 as shown above. Then add the second ES24 with these connections:

.. table::
   :class: longtable

   +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Second ES24 expansion module 1 connector SAS 0 to Z series node 1, next unused SAS connector from the left. |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Second ES24 expansion module 2 connector SAS 0 to Z series node 2, next unused SAS connector from the left. |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


After all SAS cables have been connected, plug the X series power
cords into power outlets.


Install Bezel (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included bezel is not required for operation. If desired, install
the bezel by aligning it with the pins on the bezel ears and pressing
it into place.
