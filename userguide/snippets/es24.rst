Connect Power Cords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Do not plug the power cords into a power outlet yet.**
Connect a power cord to the back of one power supply. Place the cord
into the plastic clamp and press the tab into the latch to lock it in
place. Repeat the process for the second power supply and cord.

Connect The Expansion Shelf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plug the ES24 power cords into power outlets.
**Wait two minutes for the drives to start.**

If the %brand% system is on, it can remain on while the expansion
shelf is connected.


The ES24 is compatible with several %brand% systems. Typical SAS cable
connections for connecting one or two ES24 units to %brand% High
Availability (HA) systems are shown here. When a %brand% unit with
only a single storage controller is used, only cables #1 and #3 are
connected.
