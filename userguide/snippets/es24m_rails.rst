Remove Cabinet Rails from Rack Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Extend the cabinet rail until it stops. To remove the cabinet rail,
press the white release tab to the right while pulling the cabinet
rail.

Mount Cabinet Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cabinet rails are mounted on both sides of the system cabinet.
Align the cabinet rail keyholes with the three posts (ES24) or four
posts (M-Series) on the side of the chassis and slide the rail until
the post is wedged in the keyhole slot of the rail.

Align the rail hole with the screw hole and secure the rail with one
M4 screw from the rail kit.  Repeat this process to mount and secure
the second cabinet rail on the other side.


Mount the Rack Rails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Place the rail in the rack with the front end toward the front of the
rack, aligning the pins with the mounting holes in the front of the
rack. Push the pins into the holes until the latch clicks.

Place one square cage nut with the tabs vertical into the front of
the rack, directly below the top rail pin. Repeat this process on the
other front rail. The cage nuts will later support the screws used to
secure the enclosure to the rack.

For the rear end of the rail, align the pins with the mounting holes
on the rear rack. Pull the white latch toward the rear until the pins
click in place. Repeat this process for the second rear rail.

Mount the Unit in the Rack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Caution: Two people are required to safely lift the chassis for rack
installation or removal.** Do not install drives until after the
chassis has been installed in the rack, and remove all drives before
removing the chassis from the rack.

Pull the front rack rail forward until it stops. Align the cabinet
rail with the inside of the front rack rail and slide the cabinet rail
forward until it is fully seated inside the rack rail. Repeat the
process for the second rail.

When both cabinet rails are secured inside of the rack rails, gently
push the chassis until it stops halfway in. Slide the blue release
tabs on both cabinet rails toward the front of the system while
pushing the unit in until it is flush with the front of the rack.
