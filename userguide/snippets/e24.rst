E24 Expansion Shelf
-------------------

The %brand% E24 expansion shelf is a 4U, 24-bay storage expansion
unit designed specifically for use with the %brand% Storage Array.
This section covers setting up an E24 expansion shelf and connecting
it to a %brand% Storage Array.

.. index:: Install E24 Expansion Shelf Rails

Two rails and three sets of screws are included in the rail kit.
Use only the screws labeled for the type of rack in which the unit is
being installed. Take note of the engraved rails at either end of each
rail specifying whether they are for the Left (L) or Right (R) and
which end is the front and which is the back. With two people, attach
each rail to the rack using the top and bottom screw holes. The folded
ends of the rails should be inside the corners of the rack.

shows the front left attachments for an L-type rack.

.. index:: Install E24 Expansion Shelf into Rack

Next, install the E24 expansion shelf into the rack.

.. note:: To avoid personal injury, do not install drives into the
   E24 expansion shelf before racking.

With two people, place the back of the expansion shelf on the rack.
Gently push it backwards until the front panels of the expansion
shelf are pressed against the front of the rack.

Secure the expansion shelf to the rack by pushing down and
tightening the two built-in thumbscrews as indicated in
:numref:`Figure %s <appliance30>`.

.. index:: Install Drives into the E24 Expansion Shelf

Once the E24 expansion shelf is secured into the rack, insert the
included hard drives. To insert a drive, release the handle with
the tab on the right side, push it into the drive bay until the
handle starts to be pulled back, and then push the handle the rest
of the way forward to secure the drive in place.

.. index:: Connect E24 Expansion Shelf to TrueNAS Array

To connect the E24 expansion shelf to the %brand% Storage Array,
note the labels on the SAS ports on the back of the %brand% Storage
Array and the letter label on the back of the expansion shelf.
Using the included SAS cables, connect the left *In* SAS port of
the left side expander on the E24 expansion shelf to the SAS port
with the same letter on the %brand% Storage Array's primary storage
controller, the one in the top slot. If a secondary storage
controller is installed, connect the left *In* SAS port of the right
side expander to the port with the same letter on the secondary
storage controller. Refer to
:numref:`Figure %s <appliance32>`
for a detailed view.

   Example connection between E24 Expansion Shelf and %brand% Storage Array


.. note:: Please retain the second SAS cable even when only one
   controller is installed. If the %brand% system is upgraded later
   with a second storage controller, the second cable will be needed
   to connect the E24 expansion shelf.

.. index:: Plug in and Power on E24 Expansion Shelf

Before plugging in and powering on the E24 expansion shelf, make sure
the power switches on both power supplies are set to the Off
(Circle) position shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <appliance33>`.
Using the power cables provided, connect both power supplies to
appropriate power sources. Secure the power cables in place with
the plastic locks.

   E24 Power Supply


Once all the power and storage connections are set up, turn on the
expansion shelf by moving the power switches on both power supplies
to the On (line) position.

When setting up a %brand% Storage Array for the first time, wait two
minutes after powering on all expansion shelves before turning on the
%brand% Storage Array.
