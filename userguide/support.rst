.. index:: IRC
.. _IRC:

IRC
---

To ask a question in real time, you can use the *#freenas* channel on
IRC
`Freenode <http://freenode.net/>`__.
Depending on the time of day and your time zone, %brand% developers or
other users may be available to provide assistance. If no one answers
right away, remain on the channel, as other users tend to read the
channel history to answer questions as time permits.

Typically, an IRC `client
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients>`__
is used to access the *#freenas* IRC channel. Alternately, use
`webchat <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=freenas>`__
from a web browser.

To get the most out of the IRC channel, keep these points in mind:

* Do not ask "can anyone help me?". Just ask the question.

* Do not ask a question and leave. Users who know the answer cannot
  help you if you disappear.

* If no one answers, the question may be difficult to answer or it has
  been asked before. Research other resources while waiting for the
  question to be answered.

* Do not post error messages in the channel. Instead, use a pasting
  service such as `pastebin <https://pastebin.com/>`__ and paste the
  resulting URL into the IRC discussion.
