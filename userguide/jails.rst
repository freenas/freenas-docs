Jails
=====

This section describes how to use Jails, which allow users who are
comfortable with the command line to have more control over software
installation and management.

.. note:: The jails infrastructure now uses uses the iocage backend and
   the warden backend has been deprecated and is no longer supported.
   Jail creation has been removed from the legacy UI but it can still
   be used to manage existing warden jails. It is recommended to
   recreate all legacy jails using the new UI, copy over any existing
   configurations, and delete the old jail datasets once the new jails
   are working as expected. To create new Jails, log into the new UI.

By default, a
`FreeBSD jail <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freebsd_jail>`__
is created. This provides a very light-weight, operating system-level
virtualization. Consider it as another independent instance of FreeBSD
running on the same hardware, without all of the overhead usually
associated with virtualization.  The jail installs the FreeBSD
software management utilities so FreeBSD ports can be compiled and
FreeBSD packages can be installed from the command line of the jail.

It is important to understand that any users, groups, installed
software, and configurations within a jail are isolated from both the
%brand% operating system and any other jails running on that system.

.. _Jails Configuration:

Jails Configuration
-------------------

Jails are stored in a volume or dataset.
**Using a separate dataset for the**
:guilabel:`Jail Root` **is strongly recommended**. The volume
or dataset to be used must already exist or can be created with
:ref:`Volume Manager`.

.. note:: The :guilabel:`Jail Root` volume or dataset cannot be
   created on a :ref:`Share <Sharing>`.

Begin global jail configuration by choosing
:menuselection:`Jails --> Configuration`
to open the screen shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <global_jail_config_fig>`.
Jails are automatically installed into their own dataset under the
specified path as they are created. For example, if the
:guilabel:`Jail Root` is set to :file:`/mnt/volume1/dataset1` and a
jail named *jail1* is created, it is installed into its own dataset
named :file:`/mnt/volume1/dataset1/jail1`.

   Global Jail Configuration


.. warning:: If any :ref:`Plugins` are already installed, the
   :guilabel:`Jail Root`, :guilabel:`IPv4 Network`,
   :guilabel:`IPv4 Network Start Address`, and
   :guilabel:`IPv4 Network End Address` are automatically filled.
   Double-check that the pre-configured IP address values are
   appropriate for the jails and do not conflict with addresses used
   by other systems on the network.


:numref:`Table %s <global_jail_config_opts_tab>`
summarizes the fields in this configuration screen. Refer to the text
below the table for more details on how to properly configure the
:guilabel:`Jail Root` and network settings.  Some settings are only
available in :guilabel:`Advanced Mode`. To see these settings, either
click the :guilabel:`Advanced Mode` button or configure the system to
always display these settings by checking the box
:guilabel:`Show advanced fields by default` in
:menuselection:`System --> Advanced`.

When selecting the :guilabel:`Jail Root`, ensure that the size of the
selected volume or dataset is sufficient to hold the number of jails
to be installed as well as any software, log files, and data to be
stored within each jail. At a bare minimum, budget at least 2 GB per
jail and do not select a dataset that is less than 2 GB in size.

.. note:: When adding storage to a jail, be aware that the path
   size is limited to 88 characters. Make sure that the length of the
   volume name plus the dataset name plus the jail name does not
   exceed this limit.

If the network contains a DHCP server, it is recommended to check the
box :guilabel:`IPv4 DHCP` (or :guilabel:`IPv6 Autoconfigure`, for a
properly configured IPv6 network). This prevents IP address
conflicts on the network as the DHCP server automatically assigns
the jail the next available lease and records the lease as in use.

If a static IP address is needed so that users always know the IP
address of the jail, enter the start and end address for the IPv4
and/or IPv6 network. The range defined by the start and end addresses
will be automatically assigned as jails are created. For example,
when creating 5 jails on the 192.168.1.0 network, enter a
:guilabel:`IPv4 Network Start Address` of *192.168.1.100* and a
:guilabel:`IPv4 Network End Address` of *192.168.1.104*.

**When creating a start and end range on a network that contains a
DHCP server, it is important to also reserve those
addresses on the DHCP server.**
Otherwise, the DHCP server is not aware that those addresses are
being used by jails. This lead to IP address conflicts and weird
networking errors on the network.

%brand% automatically detects and displays the
:guilabel:`IPv4 Network` to which the administrative interface is
connected. This setting is important. The IP addresses used by the
jails must be pingable from the %brand% system for the jails and any
installed software to be accessible. If the network topology requires
changing the default value, a default gateway and possibly a static
route need to be added to the specified network. After changing this
value, ensure that the subnet mask value is correct, as an incorrect
mask can make the IP network unreachable. When in doubt, keep the
default setting for :guilabel:`IPv4 Network`. With VMware, make sure
that the vswitch is set to "promiscuous mode". With VirtualBox, make sure
:menuselection:`Network -> Advanced -> Promiscuous Mode`
is not set to "Deny".

After clicking the :guilabel:`Save` button to save the configuration,
the system is ready to create and manage jails as described in the
rest of this chapter.

:numref:`Table %s <jail_config_opts_tab>`
summarizes the available options. Most settings are only available in
:guilabel:`Advanced Mode` and are not needed if the intent is to
create a FreeBSD jail. To see these settings, either click the
:guilabel:`Advanced Mode` button or configure the system to always
display these settings by checking the box
:guilabel:`Show advanced fields by default` in
:menuselection:`System --> Advanced`.

.. note:: The IPv4 and IPv6 bridge interface is used to bridge the
   `epair(4) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=epair>`__
   device, which is automatically created for each started jail, to a
   physical network device. The default network device is the one that
   is configured with a default gateway. So, if *em0* is the FreeBSD
   name of the physical interface and three jails are running, these
   virtual interfaces are automatically created:
   *bridge0*,
   *epair0a*,
   *epair1a*, and
   *epair2a.* The physical interface
   *em0* will be added to the bridge, as well as each epair device.
   The other half of the epair is placed inside the jail and is
   assigned the IP address specified for that jail. The bridge
   interface is assigned an alias of the default gateway for that
   jail or the bridge IP, if configured; either is
   correct.

.. _Managing Jails:

Managing Jails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click :guilabel:`Jails` to view and configure the added jails. In the
example shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <view_added_jails_fig>`,
the list entry for the jail named *xdm_1* has been clicked to enable
that jail's configuration options. The entry indicates the jail name,
IP address, whether it will start automatically at system boot, if it
is currently running, and jail type: *standard* for a FreeBSD jail, or
*pluginjail* if it was installed using :ref:`Plugins`.


.. _view_added_jails_fig:

.. figure:: images/jails4b.png

   Viewing Jails


From left to right, these configuration icons are available:

**Edit Jail:** edit the jail settings which were described in
:numref:`Table %s <jail_config_opts_tab>`.

After a jail has been created, the jail name and type cannot be
changed. These fields are grayed out.

.. note:: To modify the IP address information for a jail, use the
   :guilabel:`Edit Jail` button instead of the associated networking
   commands from the command line of the jail.

**Add Storage:** configure the jail to access an area of
storage as described in :ref:`Add Storage`.

**Start/Stop:** this icon changes appearance depending on the current
:guilabel:`Status` of the jail. When the jail is not running, the icon
is green and clicking it starts the jail. When the jail is already
running, the icon is red and clicking it stops the jail. A stopped
jail and its applications are inaccessible until it is restarted.

**Restart:** restart the jail.

**Shell:** access a *root* command prompt to configure the selected
jail from the command line. When finished, type :command:`exit` to
close the shell.

**Delete:** delete the jail and any periodic snapshots of it. The
contents of the jail are entirely removed.

  .. warning:: Back up data and programs in the jail before deleting
     it. There is no way to recover the contents of a jail after
     deletion.


.. _Accessing a Jail Using SSH:

Accessing a Jail Using SSH
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:command:`ssh` can be used to access a jail instead of the jail's
:guilabel:`Shell` icon. This requires starting the :command:`ssh`
service and creating a user account for :command:`ssh` access. Start
by clicking the :guilabel:`Shell` icon for the desired jail.

Find the :samp:`sshd_enable=` line in the jail's
:file:`/etc/rc.conf` and set it to *"YES"*:

.. code-block:: none

   sshd_enable="YES"


Then start the SSH daemon:

.. code-block:: none

   service sshd start


The first time the service runs, the jail's RSA key pair is generated
and the key fingerprint and random art image displayed.

Add a user account by typing :command:`adduser` and following the
prompts. If the user needs superuser privileges, they must be added to
the *wheel* group. For those users, enter *wheel* at this prompt:

.. code-block:: none

   Login group is user1. Invite user1 into other groups? []: wheel


After creating the user, set the *root* password so that the new user
will be able to use the :command:`su` command to gain superuser
privilege. To set the password, type :command:`passwd` then enter and
confirm the desired password.

Finally, test from another system that the user can successfully
:command:`ssh` in and become the superuser. In this example, a user
named *user1* uses :command:`ssh` to access the jail at 192.168.2.3.
The first time the user logs in, they will be asked to verify the
fingerprint of the host:

.. code-block:: none

   ssh user1@192.168.2.3
   The authenticity of host '192.168.2.3 (192.168.2.3)' can't be established.
   RSA key fingerprint is 6f:93:e5:36:4f:54:ed:4b:9c:c8:c2:71:89:c1:58:f0.
   Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
   Warning: Permanently added '192.168.2.3' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
   Password: type_password_here


.. note:: Each jail has its own user accounts and service
   configuration. These steps must be repeated for each jail that
   requires SSH access.


.. _Add Storage:

Add Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to give a FreeBSD jail access to an area of storage on
the %brand% system. This is useful for applications that store a
large amount of data or if an application in a jail needs access to
the data stored on the %brand% system. One example is transmission,
which stores torrents. The storage is added using the
`mount_nullfs(8)
<https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mount_nullfs>`__
mechanism, which links data that resides outside of the jail as a
storage area within the jail.

To add storage, click the :guilabel:`Add Storage` button for a
highlighted jail entry to open the screen shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <adding_storage_jail_fig>`.
This screen can also be accessed by expanding the jail name in the
tree view and clicking
:menuselection:`Storage --> Add Storage`.


.. _adding_storage_jail_fig:

.. figure:: images/jails5a.png

   Adding Storage to a Jail


Browse to the :guilabel:`Source` and :guilabel:`Destination`, where:

* **Source:** is the directory or dataset on the %brand% system
  which will be accessed by the jail. This directory **must** reside
  outside of the volume or dataset being used by the jail. This is why
  it is recommended to create a separate dataset to store jails, so
  the dataset holding the jails is always separate from any datasets
  used for storage on the %brand% system.

* **Destination:** select an **existing, empty** directory within the
  jail to link to the :guilabel:`Source` storage area. If that
  directory does not exist yet, enter the desired directory name and
  check the :guilabel:`Create directory` box.

Storage is typically added because the user and group account
associated with an application installed inside of a jail needs to
access data stored on the %brand% system. Before selecting the
:guilabel:`Source`, it is important to first ensure that the
permissions of the selected directory or dataset grant permission to
the user/group account inside of the jail. This is not the default, as
the users and groups created inside of a jail are totally separate
from the users and groups of the %brand% system.

The workflow for adding storage usually goes like this:

#.  Determine the name of the user and group account used by the
    application. For example, the installation of the transmission
    application automatically creates a user account named
    *transmission* and a group account also named *transmission*. When
    in doubt, check the files :file:`/etc/passwd` (to find the user
    account) and :file:`/etc/group` (to find the group account) inside
    the jail. Typically, the user and group names are similar to
    the application name. Also, the UID and GID are usually the same
    as the port number used by the service.

    A *media* user and group (GID 8675309) are part of the base
    system. Having applications run as this group or user makes it
    possible to share storage between multiple applications in a
    single jail, between multiple jails, or even between the host and
    jails.

#.  On the %brand% system, create a user account and group account
    that match the user and group names used by the application in
    the jail.

#.  Decide whether the jail should have access to existing data or if
    a new area of storage will be set aside for the jail to use.

#.  If the jail will access existing data, edit the permissions of
    the volume or dataset so the user and group accounts have the
    desired read and write access. If multiple applications or jails
    are to have access to the same data, create a new group and add
    each needed user account to that group.

#.  If an area of storage is being set aside for that jail or
    individual application, create a dataset. Edit the permissions of
    that dataset so the user and group account has the desired read
    and write access.

#.  Use the :guilabel:`Add Storage` button of the jail and select the
    configured volume/dataset as the :guilabel:`Source`.

To prevent writes to the storage, check the box :guilabel:`Read-Only`.

By default, the :guilabel:`Create directory` box is checked. This
means that the directory will automatically be created under the
specified :guilabel:`Destination` path if the directory does not
already exist.

After storage has been added or created, it appears in the tree
under the specified jail. In the example shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <jail_example_storage_fig>`,
a dataset named :file:`volume1/data` has been chosen as the
:guilabel:`Source` as it contains the files stored on the %brand%
system. When the storage was created, the user browsed to
:file:`volume1/jails/freebsd1/usr/local` in the
:guilabel:`Destination` field, then entered *test* as the directory.
Since this directory did not already exist, it was created, because
the :guilabel:`Create directory` box was left checked. The resulting
storage was added to the *freenas1* entry in the tree as
:file:`/usr/local/test`. The user has clicked this
:file:`/usr/local/test` entry to access the :guilabel:`Edit` screen.


.. _jail_example_storage_fig:

.. figure:: images/jails6a.png

   Example Storage


Storage is normally mounted as it is created. To unmount the storage,
uncheck the :guilabel:`Mounted?` box.

.. note:: A mounted dataset does not automatically mount any of its
   child datasets. While the child datasets may appear to be browsable
   inside the jail, any changes are not visible. Since each
   dataset is considered to be its own filesystem, each child dataset
   must have its own mount point. Separate storage must be created
   for any child datasets which need to be mounted.

To delete the storage, click the :guilabel:`Delete` button.

.. warning:: It is important to realize that added storage is really
   just a pointer to the selected storage directory on the %brand%
   system. It does **not** copy that data to the jail.
   **Files that are deleted from the**
   :guilabel:`Destination`
   **directory in the jail are really deleted from the**
   :guilabel:`Source`
   **directory on the** %brand% **system.**
   However, removing the jail storage entry only removes the pointer,
   leaving the data intact but not accessible from the jail.


.. _Starting Installed Software:

Starting Installed Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After packages or ports are installed, they need to be configured and
started. If you are familiar with the software, look for the
configuration file in :file:`/usr/local/etc` or a subdirectory of it.
Many FreeBSD packages contain a sample configuration file as a
reference. If you are unfamiliar with the software, you will need to
spend some time at the software's website to learn which configuration
options are available and which configuration files require editing.

Most FreeBSD packages that contain a startable service include a
startup script which is automatically installed to
:file:`/usr/local/etc/rc.d/`. After the configuration is complete, the
starting of the service can be tested by running the script with the
:command:`onestart` option. As an example, if openvpn is installed
into the jail, these commands run its startup script and verify that
the service started:

.. code-block:: none

   /usr/local/etc/rc.d/openvpn onestart
   Starting openvpn.

   /usr/local/etc/rc.d/openvpn onestatus
   openvpn is running as pid 45560.

   sockstat -4
   USER	COMMAND		PID	FD	PROTO	LOCAL ADDRESS	FOREIGN ADDRESS
   root	openvpn		48386   4	udp4	*:54789		*:*

If it produces an error:

.. code-block:: none

   /usr/local/etc/rc.d/openvpn onestart
   Starting openvpn.
   /usr/local/etc/rc.d/openvpn: WARNING: failed to start openvpn

Run :command:`tail /var/log/messages` to see if any error messages
hint at the problem. Most startup failures are related to a
misconfiguration: either a typo or a missing option in a
configuration file.

After verifying that the service starts and is working as intended,
add a line to :file:`/etc/rc.conf` to start the
service automatically when the jail is started. The line to
start a service always ends in *_enable="YES"* and typically starts
with the name of the software. For example, this is the entry for the
openvpn service:

.. code-block:: none

   openvpn_enable="YES"


When in doubt, the startup script shows the line to put in
:file:`/etc/rc.conf`. This is the description in
:file:`/usr/local/etc/rc.d/openvpn`:

.. code-block:: none

   # This script supports running multiple instances of openvpn.
   # To run additional instances link this script to something like
   # % ln -s openvpn openvpn_foo

   # and define additional openvpn_foo_* variables in one of
   # /etc/rc.conf, /etc/rc.conf.local or /etc/rc.conf.d /openvpn_foo

   #
   # Below NAME should be substituted with the name of this script. By default
   # it is openvpn, so read as openvpn_enable. If you linked the script to
   # openvpn_foo, then read as openvpn_foo_enable etc.
   #
   # The following variables are supported (defaults are shown).
   # You can place them in any of
   # /etc/rc.conf, /etc/rc.conf.local or /etc/rc.conf.d/NAME
   #
   # NAME_enable="NO"
   # set to YES to enable openvpn

The startup script also indicates if any additional parameters are
available:

.. code-block:: none

   # NAME_if=
   # driver(s) to load, set to "tun", "tap" or "tun tap"
   #
   # it is OK to specify the if_ prefix.
   #
   # # optional:
   # NAME_flags=
   # additional command line arguments
   # NAME_configfile="/usr/local/etc/openvpn/NAME.conf"
   # --config file
   # NAME_dir="/usr/local/etc/openvpn"
   # --cd directory

.. index:: iocage
.. _Using iocage:

Using iocage
------------

Beginning with %brand% 9.10.1, the
`iocage <https://github.com/iocage/iocage>`__
command line utility is included for creating and managing jails. Click
the :guilabel:`Shell` option to open the command line and begin using
iocage.

.. note:: The jails infrastructure is transitioning from the old
   warden backend to the new iocage backend. This transition process
   requires the middleware API calls to be rewritten for the new UI. It
   is expected that the transition will be complete with %brand% version
   11.2. Since jails created in the old UI use the warden backend, jails
   created in the new UI use the iocage backend, and both use different
   API versions, they are not compatible. While a migration script will
   be made available when the transition is complete, it will not be able
   to anticipate every configuration scenario for every application
   installed in jails. At that time, the recommendation will be to: create
   new jails using the new UI, copy over any existing configurations, and
   delete the old jail datasets once the new jails are working as expected.

Iocage has several options to help users:

* There is built-in help displayed by entering
  :samp:`iocage --help | more`. Each subcommand also has help, displayed
  by giving the subcommand name followed by the :literal:`--help` flag.
  For example, help for the :command:`activate` subcommand displays with
  :samp:`iocage activate --help`.

* The iocage manual page is accessed by typing :samp:`man iocage`.

* The iocage project also has documentation available on
  `readthedocs.io <http://iocage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__.


Managing iocage Jails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating a jail automatically starts the iocage configuration process for
the %brand% system. Jail properties can also be specified with the
:command:`iocage create` command.

In this example a new jail named *examplejail* is created. Additional
properties are a manually designated IP address of *192.168.1.10*, a
netmask of */24* on the *em0* interface, and using the FreeBSD
11.1-RELEASE:

.. code-block:: none

   [root@freenas ~]# iocage create -n examplejail ip4_addr="em0|192.168.1.10/24" -r
   11.1-RELEASE
   ...
   examplejail successfully created!

Jail creation may take a few moments. After completion, start the new
jail with :command:`iocage start`:

.. code-block:: none

   [root@freenas ~]# iocage start examplejail
   * Starting examplejail
   + Started OK
   + Starting services OK

To open the console in the started jail, use :command:`iocage console`

.. code-block:: none

   [root@freenas ~]# iocage console examplejail

Jails can be shut down with :command:`iocage stop`:

.. code-block:: none

   [root@freenas ~]# iocage stop examplejail
   * Stopping examplejail
     + Running prestop OK
     + Stopping services OK
     + Removing jail process OK
     + Running poststop OK

Jails are deleted with :command:`iocage destroy`:

.. code-block:: none

   [root@freenas ~]# iocage destroy examplejail

   This will destroy jail examplejail

   Are you sure? [y/N]: y
   Destroying examplejail


To adjust the properties of a jail, use :command:`iocage set` and
:command:`iocage get`. All properties of a jail are viewed with
:command:`iocage get all`:

.. tip:: This example shows an abbreviated list of **examplejail**'s
   properties. The iocage manual page (:command:`man iocage`) describes
   even more configurable properties for jails.

.. code-block:: none

   [root@freenas ~]# iocage get all examplejail | less
   allow_mount:0
   allow_mount_devfs:0
   allow_sysvipc:0
   available:readonly
   basejail:no
   boot:off
   bpf:no
   children_max:0
   cloned_release:11.1-RELEASE
   comment:none
   compression:lz4
   compressratio:readonly
   coredumpsize:off
   count:1
   cpuset:off
   cputime:off
   datasize:off
   dedup:off
   defaultrouter:none
   defaultrouter6:none
   ...

To adjust a jail property, use :command:`iocage set`:

.. code-block:: none

   [root@freenas ~]# iocage set notes="This is a testing jail." examplejail
   Property: notes has been updated to This is a testing jail.
