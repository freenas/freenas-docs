   Reporting Graphs


%brand% uses
`collectd <https://collectd.org/>`__
to provide reporting statistics. For a clearer picture, hover over a
point in the graph to show exact numbers for that point in time. Use the
magnifier buttons next to each graph to increase or decrease the
displayed time increment from 10 minutes, hourly, daily, weekly, or
monthly. The :guilabel:`<<` and :guilabel:`>>` buttons scroll through
the output.

.. note:: Reporting graphs do not appear if there is no related data.

Graphs are grouped by category on the Reporting page:

* :guilabel:`CPU`

  * `CPU <https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:CPU>`__
    shows the amount of time spent by the CPU in various states
    such as executing user code, executing system code, and being
    idle. Graphs of short-, mid-, and long-term load are shown, along
    with CPU temperature graphs.

* :guilabel:`Disk`

  * `Disk <https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Disk>`__
    shows read and write statistics on I/O, percent busy, latency,
    operations per second, pending I/O requests, and disk temperature.
    Choose the :guilabel:`DEVICES` and :guilabel:`METRICS` to view the
    selected metrics for the chosen devices.

* :guilabel:`Memory`

  * `Memory <https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Memory>`__
    displays memory usage.

  * `Swap <https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Swap>`__
    displays the amount of free and used swap space.

  * `Interface <https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Interface>`__
    shows received and transmitted traffic in megabytes per second for
    each configured interface.

* :guilabel:`Partition`

  * `Disk space
    <https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:DF>`__
    displays free, used, and reserved space for each pool and dataset.
    However, the disk space used by an individual zvol is not
    displayed as it is a block device.

* :guilabel:`System`

  * `Processes
    <https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Processes>`__
    displays the number of processes. It is grouped by state.

* :guilabel:`Target`

  * Target shows bandwidth statistics for iSCSI ports.

* :guilabel:`ZFS`

  * `ZFS <https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:ZFS_ARC>`__
    shows compressed physical ARC size, hit ratio, demand data, demand
    metadata, and prefetch data.
