   Reporting Graphs


%brand% uses
`collectd <https://collectd.org/>`__
to provide reporting statistics. For a clearer picture, hover over each
legend icon to highlight the respective line on the graph. The resulting
graphs are grouped into several tabs on the Reporting page:

* :guilabel:`CPU`

  * `CPU <https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:CPU>`__
    shows the amount of time spent by the CPU in various states
    such as executing user code, executing system code, and being
    idle. It also shows the load on the CPU for a short term, mid term,
    and long term.

* :guilabel:`Disk`

  * `Disk <https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Disk>`__
    shows read and write statistics on I/O, percent busy, latency,
    operations per second, pending I/O requests, and disk temperature.

* :guilabel:`Memory`

  * `Memory <https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Memory>`__
    displays memory usage.

  * `Swap <https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Swap>`__
    displays the amount of free and used swap space.

* :guilabel:`Network`

  * `Interface
    <https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Interface>`__
    shows received and transmitted traffic in bits per second for
    each configured interface.

* :guilabel:`Partition`

  * `Disk space
    <https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:DF>`__
    displays free, used, and reserved space for each pool and dataset.
    However, the disk space used by an individual zvol is not
    displayed as it is a block device.

* :guilabel:`System`

  * `Processes and Uptime
    <https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Processes>`__
    displays the number of processes. It is grouped by state.

  * `Uptime <https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Uptime>`__
    keeps track of the system uptime.

* :guilabel:`Target`

  * Target shows bandwidth statistics for iSCSI ports.

* :guilabel:`ZFS`

  * `ZFS <https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:ZFS_ARC>`__
    shows ARC size, hit ratio, demand data, demand metadata, prefetch
    data, and prefetch metadata.


Reporting data is saved to permit viewing and monitoring usage trends
over time. This data is preserved across system upgrades and restarts.

Data files are saved in :file:`/var/db/collectd/rrd/`.

The reporting data file recording method is controlled by the
:menuselection:`System --> System Dataset`
:guilabel:`Reporting database` checkbox. When unchecked, data files
are recorded in a temporary filesystem and copied hourly to on-disk
files.

When
:menuselection:`System --> System Dataset`
:guilabel:`Reporting database` is checked, data files are written
directly to the :ref:`System Dataset`.

.. warning:: Reporting data is frequently written and should not be
   stored on the boot pool or boot device.

Use the mouse wheel while hovering over the graph to zoom in the time
interval. Click and drag the selection box to scroll horizontally over
the time interval.
