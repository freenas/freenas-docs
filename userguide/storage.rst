Pools
-----

:menuselection:`Storage --> Pools` is used to create and manage ZFS
pools, datasets, and zvols.

Proper storage design is important for any NAS.
**Please read through this entire chapter before configuring storage
disks. Features are described to help make it clear which are
beneficial for particular uses, and caveats or hardware restrictions
which limit usefulness.**


.. _Creating Pools:

Creating Pools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before creating a pool, determine the level of required redundancy, how
many disks will be added, and if any data exists on those disks.
Creating a pool overwrites disk data, so save any required data to
different media before adding disks to a pool.

Navigate to :menuselection:`Storage --> Pools`
and click |ui-add| to open the screen shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <create_pool_poolman_fig>`.


.. _create_pool_poolman_fig:

.. figure:: images/storage-pools-pool-create.png

   Creating a Pool


Select :guilabel:`Create new pool` and click :guilabel:`Create Pool`
to continue.

Enter a name for the pool in the :guilabel:`Name` field. Ensure
that the chosen name conforms to these
`naming conventions <https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/821-1448/gbcpt.html>`__.
Choosing a name that will stick out in the logs is recommended,
rather than generic names like :file:`data` or :file:`freenas`.

If the underlying disks need to be encrypted as a protection against
physical theft, set the :guilabel:`Encryption` option. A pop-up message
shows a reminder to
**Always back up the key!**. Without
the key, the data on the disks is inaccessible. Select
:guilabel:`Confirm` then click :guilabel:`Ok`.

.. warning:: Refer to the warnings in :ref:`Managing Encrypted Pools`
   before enabling encryption! Be aware that this form of encryption
   will be replaced by OpenZFS native encryption in a future version.
   Pools created with the current encryption mechanism will need to be
   backed up and destroyed in order to be recreated with native
   encryption when it becomes available.


In the :guilabel:`Available Disks` section, select the disks that will be
added to the pool. Click :guilabel:`Filter disks by name` or
:guilabel:`Filter disks by capacity` to change the order of displayed
disks.

.. note:: The usable space of each disk in a pool is limited to the
   size of the smallest disk in the pool. Because of this, creating
   pools with disks of the same size is recommended.


After selecting the desired disks, click the right arrow to add them to
the :guilabel:`Data VDevs` section. Any disks that appear in
:guilabel:`Data VDevs` are used to create the pool. To remove a disk
from that section, select the disk and use the left arrow to return it to
the :guilabel:`Available Disks` section.

To add multiple :guilabel:`Data VDevs`, click :guilabel:`Add Data` for
each required additional vdev.

Alternately, click the :guilabel:`Suggest Layout` button which will
add all of the disks and suggest an optimal layout for both redundancy
and capacity.

The pool layout is dependent upon the number of disks added to
:guilabel:`Data VDevs` and the number of available layouts increases as
disks are added. To view the available layouts, ensure that at least one
disk appears in :guilabel:`Data VDevs` and select the drop-down menu
under this section. The UI will automatically update the
:guilabel:`Estimated raw capacity` when a layout is selected. These
layouts are supported:

* **Stripe:** requires at least one disk

* **Mirror:** requires at least two disks

* **RAIDZ1:** requires at least three disks

* **RAIDZ2:** requires at least four disks

* **RAIDZ3:** requires at least five disks

.. warning:: Refer to the :ref:`ZFS Primer` for more information on
   redundancy and disk layouts. When more than five disks are used,
   consideration must be given to the optimal layout for the best
   performance and scalability.It is important to realize that different
   layouts of virtual devices (*vdevs*) affect which operations can be
   performed on that pool later. For example, drives can be added to a
   mirror to increase redundancy, but that is not possible with RAIDZ
   arrays.


Once the desired layout is configured, click :guilabel:`Create`. A pop-up
warning servers as a reminder that all disk contents will be erased.
Enable the :guilabel:`Confirm` option then click :guilabel:`Ok` to create
the pool.

.. note:: To instead preserve existing data, click the
   :guilabel:`Cancel` button and refer to :ref:`Importing a Disk` and
   :ref:`Importing a Pool` to see if the existing format is supported.
   If so, perform that action instead. If the current storage format is
   not supported, it is necessary to back up the data to external media,
   create the pool, then restore the data to the new pool.


Depending on the size and number of disks, the type of controller, and
whether encryption is selected, creating the pool may take some time.
If the :guilabel:`Encryption` option was selected, a popup message
will provide a link to :guilabel:`Download Recovery Key`. Click the link
and save the key to a safe location. When finished, click
:guilabel:`Done`.

Once the pool is created, the screen refreshes and the new pool is
listed in :menuselection:`Storage --> Pools`.

In the example shown in :numref:`Figure %s <zfs_vol_fig>`, the created
pool is named *pool1*. Its description indicates that it is HEALTHY
and its :guilabel:`Used` and :guilabel:`Free` entries reflect the total
size of the pool, including disk parity.

Click the down arrow to see more details about the pool. This second
entry has the same name and represents the implicit or root dataset. Its
:guilabel:`Used` and :guilabel:`Available` entries indicate the amount
of disk space available for storage, after disk parity. It also
indicates the type of :guilabel:`Compression`, the
:guilabel:`Compression Ratio`, whether it is mounted as read-only,
whether :guilabel:`Deduplication` has been enabled, its mountpoint path,
and any :guilabel:`Comments` entered for the pool.

There is an option to :guilabel:`Upgrade Pool`. This upgrades the pool
to the latest ZFS features, as described in :ref:`Upgrading a ZFS Pool`.
This button does not appear if the pool is running the latest version of
feature flags.

.. index:: Encryption
.. _Managing Encrypted Pools:

Managing Encrypted Pools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: The encryption facility used by %brand% is designed to
   protect against physical theft of the disks. It is not designed to
   protect against unauthorized software access. Ensure that only
   authorized users have access to the administrative GUI and that
   proper permissions are set on shares if sensitive data is stored on
   the system.


%brand% supports `GELI
<https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=geli>`__ full disk encryption
for ZFS pools. It is important to understand the details before creating
a pool with encryption:

* %brand% encryption is different from the encryption used in
  Oracle's proprietary, non-open source version of ZFS.

* In %brand%, entire disks are encrypted, not individual filesystems.
  Encrypted devices are created from the underlying drives, then the
  pool is created on top of the encrypted devices.

* This type of encryption is primarily useful for users wanting the
  ability to remove disks from the pool without having to first wipe the
  disks of any sensitive data.

* The %brand% encryption design is only suitable for safe disposal of
  disks independent of the encryption key. As long as the key and the
  disks are intact, the system is vulnerable to being decrypted. The
  key should be protected by a strong passphrase and any backups of
  the key should be securely stored.

* If the encryption key is lost, the data on the disks is
  inaccessible. Always back up the key!

* Encryption keys are per ZFS pool and each pool has a separate
  encryption key. Technical details about how encryption keys are
  used, stored, and managed within %brand% are described in this
  `forum post
  <https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/recover-encryption-key.16593/#post-85497>`__.

* Data in memory, including ARC, is not encrypted. ZFS data on disk,
  including ZIL and SLOG, are encrypted if the underlying disks are
  encrypted. Swap data on disk is always encrypted.

  .. warning:: Data stored in Cache (L2ARC) drives is not encrypted.
     Do not use Cache (L2ARC) with encrypted pools.


* At present, there is no automated method to encrypt an existing,
  unencrypted pool. Instead, the data must be backed up, the
  existing pool destroyed, a new encrypted pool created, and the
  backup restored to the new pool.

* Hybrid pools are not supported. Added vdevs must match the existing
  encryption scheme. :ref:`Extending a Pool` automatically encrypts a
  new vdev being added to an existing encrypted pool.

Encryption performance depends upon the number of disks encrypted. The
more drives in an encrypted pool, the more encryption and decryption
overhead, and the greater the impact on performance.
**Encrypted pools composed of more than eight drives can suffer severe
performance penalties**.
If encryption is desired, please benchmark such pools before using
them in production.
#ifdef freenas

.. note:: Processors with support for the
   `AES-NI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set>`__
   instruction set are strongly recommended. These processors can
   handle encryption of a small number of disks with negligible
   performance impact. They also retain performance better as the
   number of disks increases. Older processors without the AES-NI
   instructions see significant performance impact with even a single
   encrypted disk. This `forum post
   <https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/encryption-performance-benchmarks.12157/>`__
   compares the performance of various processors.

#endif freenas

%brand% generates and stores a randomized *encryption key* whenever
a new encrypted pool is created. This key is required to read and
decrypt any data on the pool.

Encryption keys can also be downloaded as a safety measure, to allow
decryption on a different system in the event of failure, or to allow
the locally stored key to be deleted for extra security. Encryption
keys can be optionally protected with a *passphrase* for additional
security. The combination of encryption key location and whether a
passphrase is used provide several different security scenarios:

* *Key stored locally, no passphrase*: the encrypted pool is decrypted
  and accessible when the system running. Protects "data at rest" only.

* *Key stored locally, with passphrase*: the encrypted pool is not
  accessible until the passphrase is entered by the %brand%
  administrator.

* *Key not stored locally*: the encrypted pool is not accessible
  until the %brand% administrator provides the key. If a passphrase is
  set on the key, it must also be entered before the encrypted pool
  can be accessed (`two factor authentication
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication>`__).

Encrypted data cannot be accessed when the disks are removed or the
system has been shut down. On a running system, encrypted data
cannot be accessed when the pool is locked and the key is not available.
If the key is protected with a passphrase, both the key and passphrase
are required for decryption.

Encryption applies to a pool, not individual users. When a pool is
unlocked, data is accessible to all users with permissions to access
it.

.. note:: `GELI <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=geli>`__
   uses *two* randomized encryption keys for each disk. The first has
   been discussed here. The second, the disk "master key", is
   encrypted and stored in the on-disk GELI metadata. Loss of a disk
   master key due to disk corruption is equivalent to any other disk
   failure, and in a redundant pool, other disks will contain
   accessible copies of the uncorrupted data. While it is *possible*
   to separately back up disk master keys, it is usually not necessary
   or useful.


To manage the passphrase and keys on an encrypted pool, select the
pool name in :menuselection:`Storage --> Pools`, click the
:guilabel:`Encryption Operations` (lock) icon, and select one of
these operations:

**Lock:** Only appears after a passphrase has been created. When a pool
is locked, its data is not accessible until the pool is unlocked by
supplying the passphrase. For this reason, selecting this action will
prompt to confirm. Once the pool is locked, its status will change to
*LOCKED (Locked Used / Locked Free)* and the :guilabel:`Lock` menu
option will change to :guilabel:`Un-Lock`.

To unlock the pool, select :guilabel:`Un-Lock`, enter the passphrase
*or* use the :guilabel:`Browse` button to load the recovery key. If both
a passphrase and a recovery key are entered, only the passphrase is
used.  By default, the services listed will restart when the pool is
unlocked. This allows them to see the new pool and share or access
data on it. Individual services can be prevented from restarting by
deselecting them. However, a service that is not restarted might not be
able to access the unlocked pool.

**Create Passphrase:** set and confirm a passphrase associated with the
GELI encryption key.

#ifdef comment
# not visible in UI yet
A red warning is a reminder to
:guilabel:`Remember to add a new recovery key` as this action
invalidates the previous recovery key`.
#endif comment

Unlike a password, a passphrase can contain spaces and is typically a
series of words. A good passphrase is easy to remember (like the line to
a song or piece of literature) but hard to guess (people you know should
not be able to guess the passphrase).
**Remember this passphrase. An encrypted pool cannot be reimported
without it.**
In other words, if the passphrase is forgotten, the data on the pool
can become inaccessible if it becomes necessary to reimport the pool.
Protect this passphrase, as anyone who knows it could reimport the
encrypted pool, thwarting the reason for encrypting the disks in the
first place.


.. _zfs_encrypt_passphrase_fig:

.. figure:: images/storage-encrypt-passphrase.png

   Add or Change a Passphrase to an Encrypted Pool


After the passphrase is set, the name of this button changes to
:guilabel:`Change Passphrase`. After setting or changing the
passphrase, it is important to *immediately* create a new recovery key
by clicking the :guilabel:`Add recovery key` button. This way, if the
passphrase is forgotten, the associated recovery key can be used
instead.

**Add Recovery Key:** generate a new recovery key. This screen
prompts for the %brand% administrative password and then the directory
in which to save the key. Note that the recovery key is saved to the
client system, not on the %brand% system. This recovery key can be
used if the passphrase is forgotten. **Always immediately add a
recovery key whenever the passphrase is changed.**

**Delete Recovery Key:** Typically this is only performed when the
administrator suspects that the current recovery key may be
compromised. **Immediately** create a new passphrase and recovery key.


.. note:: Protect the passphrase, recovery key, and encryption key.
   Do not reveal the passphrase to others. On the system
   containing the downloaded keys, take care that the system and its
   backups are protected. Anyone who has the keys has the ability to
   re-import the disks if they are discarded or stolen.


.. warning:: If a re-key fails on a multi-disk system, an alert is
   generated. **Do not ignore this alert** as doing so may result in
   the loss of data.


**Encryption Rekey:** generate a new GELI encryption key. Typically
this is only performed when the administrator suspects that the
current key may be compromised. This action also removes the current
passphrase.
#ifdef truenas

.. note:: A re-key is not allowed if :ref:`Failover`
   (High Availability) has been enabled and the standby node is down.
#endif truenas

**Download Encrypt Key:** download a backup copy of the GELI encryption key.
The encryption key is saved to the client system, not on the %brand%
system. The %brand% administrative password must be entered,
then the directory in which to store the key is chosen. Since the GELI
encryption key is separate from the %brand% configuration database,
**it is highly recommended to make a backup of the key. If the key is
ever lost or destroyed and there is no backup key, the data on the
disks is inaccessible.**

.. _Adding Cache or Log Devices:

Adding Cache or Log Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Pools` can be used either during or after pool creation to add an
SSD as a cache or log device to improve performance of the pool under
specific use cases. Before adding a cache or log device, refer to the
:ref:`ZFS Primer` to determine if the system will benefit or suffer from
the addition of the device.

To add a Cache or Log device during pool creation, click the
:guilabel:`Add Cache` or :guilabel:`Add Log` button. Select the disk from
:guilabel:`Available Disks` and use the :guilabel:`right arrow` next to
:guilabel:`Cache VDev` or :guilabel:`Log VDev` to add it to that section.

To add a device to an existing pool in
:menuselection:`Storage --> Pools`, click the pool name,
|ui-settings|, then :guilabel:`Extend`. Click
:guilabel:`Confirm` and :guilabel:`Ok` to bypass the warning message.
This will reopen the pool creation screen described in the previous
paragraph, but with the pool name displayed as read-only.

.. index:: Hot Spares, Spares
.. _Adding Spare Devices:

Adding Spare Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ZFS provides the ability to have "hot" *spares*. These are drives that
are connected to a pool, but not in use. If the pool experiences
the failure of a data drive, the system uses the hot spare as a
temporary replacement. If the failed drive is replaced with a new
drive, the hot spare drive is no longer needed and reverts to being a
hot spare. If the failed drive is instead removed from the pool, the
spare is promoted to a full member of the pool.

Hot spares can be added to a pool during or after creation. On
%brand%, hot spare actions are implemented by
`zfsd(8) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=zfsd>`__.

To add a spare during pool creation, click the :guilabel:`Add Spare`.
button. Select the disk from :guilabel:`Available Disks` and use the
:guilabel:`right arrow` next to :guilabel:`Spare VDev` to add it to
the section.

To add a device to an existing pool, click the pool name,
|ui-settings| icon, then
:guilabel:`Extend`. Click :guilabel:`Confirm` and
:guilabel:`Ok` to bypass the warning message. This will reopen the pool
creation screen described in the previous paragraph, but with the pool
name displayed as read-only.

.. _Extending a Pool:

Extending a Pool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To increase the capacity of an existing pool, click the pool name,
|ui-settings|, then
:guilabel:`Extend`. A popup warning displays a reminder to stripe vdevs
of the same size and type. Click :guilabel:`Confirm` and
:guilabel:`Ok` to continue.

.. note:: If the existing pool is encrypted, an additional warning message 
   shows a reminder that **extending a pool resets the passphrase and
   recovery key**. After extending the pool, another popup message will
   provide a link to :guilabel:`Download Recovery Key`. Click the link and
   save the key to a safe location. When finished, click :guilabel:`Done`.

When adding disks to increase the capacity of a pool, ZFS supports
the addition of virtual devices, or *vdevs*, to an existing ZFS
pool. A vdev can be a single disk, a stripe, a mirror, a RAIDZ1,
RAIDZ2, or a RAIDZ3.
**After a vdev is created, more drives cannot be added to that vdev**.
However, a new vdev can be striped with another
of the **same type of existing vdev** to increase the overall size of
the pool. Extending a pool often involves striping similar vdevs.
Here are some examples:

* to extend a ZFS stripe, add one or more disks. Since there is no
  redundancy, disks do not have to be added in the same quantity as
  the existing stripe.

* to extend a ZFS mirror, add the same number of drives. The resulting
  striped mirror is a RAID 10. For example, if ten new drives are
  available, a mirror of two drives could be created initially, then
  extended by creating another mirror of two drives, and repeating
  three more times until all ten drives have been added.

* to extend a three drive RAIDZ1, add three additional drives. The
  result is a RAIDZ+0, similar to RAID 50 on a hardware controller.

* to extend a RAIDZ2 requires a minimum of four additional drives. The
  result is a RAIDZ2+0, similar to RAID 60 on a hardware controller.


.. warning:: Make sure to select the same number of disks and disk
   layout when extending the pool!


.. _Detaching a Pool:

Detaching a Pool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To export or destroy an existing pool, click the pool name,
|ui-settings|, then
:guilabel:`Detach`. The choice to retain or delete the contents of the
pool depends upon the selections made in the screen shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <zfs_detach_vol_fig>`.


  .. _zfs_detach_vol_fig:

  .. figure:: images/storage-pools-actions-detach.png

     Detach or Delete a Pool


#ifdef truenas
.. note:: When the system has :ref:`High Availability (HA) <Failover>`
   active, pools cannot be exported or destroyed.
#endif truenas


.. warning:: Do not detach an encrypted pool if the passphrase has not
   been set! **An encrypted pool cannot be reimported without a passphrase!**
   When in doubt, use the instructions in :ref:`Managing Encrypted Pools`
   to set a passphrase.


The :guilabel:`Detach Pool` screen provides options to
:guilabel:`Destroy data on this pool?` and to
:guilabel:`Confirm detach`.

To detach the pool while retaining the data on the pool, select the
:guilabel:`Confirm detach` option and click the
:guilabel:`Detach` button. This operation allows the pool to be
re-imported at a later time. For example, when moving a pool from one
system to another, perform this detach action first to flush any unwritten
data to disk, write data to the disk indicating that the export was done,
and remove all knowledge of the pool from this system.

To instead destroy the data on the pool, set both options. This instructs
the system to destroy the data on the pool, its datasets, zvols, and
shares and to return its individual disks are to their raw state.


.. warning:: Before destroying a pool, ensure that any needed data has
   been backed up to a different pool or system.

Importing a Pool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This action can be used to reimport a detached pool, import a pool that

existing %brand% system.

When physically installing ZFS pool disks from another system, use the
:samp:`zpool export {poolname}` command or a GUI equivalent to export
the pool on that system. Then shut it down and connect the drives to
the %brand% system. This prevents an "in use by another machine" error
during the import to %brand%.

Configure %brand% to import an existing ZFS pool by navigating

   :ref:`Managing Encrypted Pools` for instructions on managing keys.


After the pool is decrypted, it can be imported.


.. note:: For security reasons, GELI keys for encrypted pools are
   not saved in a configuration backup file. When %brand% has been
   installed to a new device and a saved configuration file restored
   to it, the GELI keys for encrypted disks will not be present, and
   the system will not request them. To correct this, export the
   encrypted pool with Detach Pool, making sure that the options
   :guilabel:`Mark the disks as new (destroy data)` or

After a dataset is created it appears in :menuselection:`Storage --> Pools.`
Click |ui-options| on an existing dataset to configure these options:

**Add Dataset:** create a nested dataset, or a dataset within a dataset.

**Add Zvol:** add a zvol to the dataset. Refer to :ref:`Adding Zvols`
for more information about zvols.

**Edit Options:** edit the pool properties described in
:numref:`Table %s <zfs_create_dataset>`. Note that the
:guilabel:`Dataset Name`, :guilabel:`Case Sensitivity`, and
:guilabel:`Record Size` are read-only as they cannot be edited
after dataset creation.

**Edit Permissions:** refer to :ref:`Setting Permissions` for more
information about permissions.

**Delete Dataset:** clicking this option will popup a warning as a
reminder that this irreversible action will also delete all snapshots for
the dataset.
Set the :guilabel:`Confirm` option then click :guilabel:`Ok` to
destroy the dataset and all of its contents.

**Promote Dataset:** only appears on clones. When a clone is promoted,
the origin filesystem becomes a clone of the clone making it possible
to destroy the filesystem that the clone was created from. Otherwise,
a clone cannot be destroyed while the origin filesystem exists.

**Create Snapshot:** create a one-time snapshot. To schedule the
regular creation of snapshots, instead use
:ref:`Periodic Snapshot Tasks`.

.. index:: Deduplication
.. _Deduplication:

Deduplication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deduplication is the process of ZFS transparently reusing a single
copy of duplicated data to save space. Depending on the amount of
duplicate data, deduplicaton can improve storage capacity, as less
data is written and stored. However, deduplication is RAM intensive. A
general rule of thumb is 5 GB of RAM per terabyte of deduplicated
storage. **In most cases, compression provides storage gains
comparable to deduplication with less impact on performance.**

In %brand%, deduplication can be enabled during dataset creation. Be
forewarned that **there is no way to undedup the data within a dataset
once deduplication is enabled**, as disabling deduplication has
**NO EFFECT** on existing data. The more data written to a deduplicated
dataset, the more RAM it requires. When the system starts storing the
DDTs (dedup tables) on disk because they no longer fit into RAM,
performance craters. Further, importing an unclean pool can require
between 3-5 GB of RAM per terabyte of deduped data, and if the system
does not have the needed RAM, it will panic. The only solution is to add
more RAM or recreate the pool. **Think carefully before enabling dedup!**
This `article
<https://constantin.glez.de/2011/07/27/zfs-to-dedupe-or-not-dedupe/>`__
provides a good description of the value versus cost considerations
for deduplication.

**Unless a lot of RAM and a lot of duplicate data is available, do not
change the default deduplication setting of "Off".**
For performance reasons, consider using compression rather than
turning this option on.

If deduplication is changed to *On*, duplicate data blocks are removed
synchronously. The result is that only unique data is stored and common
components are shared among files. If deduplication is changed to
*Verify*, ZFS will do a byte-to-byte comparison when two blocks have the
same signature to make sure that the block contents are identical. Since
hash collisions are extremely rare, *Verify* is usually not worth the
performance hit.

.. note:: After deduplication is enabled, the only way to disable it
   is to use the :samp:`zfs set dedup=off {dataset_name}` command
   from :ref:`Shell`. However, any data that has already been
   deduplicated will not be un-deduplicated. Only newly stored data
   after the property change will not be deduplicated. The only way to
   remove existing deduplicated data is to copy all of the data off of
   the dataset, set the property to off, then copy the data back in
   again. Alternately, create a new dataset with
   :guilabel:`ZFS Deduplication` left at *Off*, copy the data to the
   new dataset, and destroy the original dataset.
#endif freenas

.. tip:: Deduplication is often considered when using a group of very
   similar virtual machine images. However, other features of ZFS can
   provide dedup-like functionality more efficiently. For example,
   create a dataset for a standard VM, then clone a snapshot of that
   dataset for other VMs. Only the difference between each created VM and
   the main dataset are saved, giving the effect of deduplication without
   the overhead.


.. index:: Compression
.. _Compression:

Compression
^^^^^^^^^^^

When selecting a compression type, balancing performance
with the amount of disk space saved by compression is recommended.
Compression is transparent to the client and applications as ZFS automatically
compresses data as it is written to a compressed dataset or zvol and
automatically decompresses that data as it is read. These compression
algorithms are supported:

* **LZ4:** default and recommended compression method as it allows
  compressed datasets to operate at near real-time speed. This algorithm
  only compresses files that will benefit from compression.

* **GZIP:** levels 1, 6, and 9 where *gzip fastest* (level 1)
  gives the least compression and *gzip maximum* (level 9) provides
  the best compression but is discouraged due to its performance
  impact.

* **ZLE:** fast but simple algorithm which eliminates runs of zeroes.

If *OFF* is selected as the :guilabel:`Compression level` when creating
a dataset or zvol, compression will not be used on that dataset/zvol.
This is not recommended as using *LZ4* has a negligible performance
impact and allows for more storage capacity.


.. index:: ZVOL
.. _Adding Zvols:

Adding Zvols
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A zvol is a feature of ZFS that creates a raw block device over ZFS.
The zvol can be used as an :ref:`iSCSI` device extent.

To create a zvol, select an existing ZFS pool or dataset, click
|ui-options|, then :guilabel:`Add Zvol` to open the screen shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <zfs_create_zvol_fig>`.

Click |ui-options| next to the desired zvol in

Similar to datasets, a zvol name cannot be
changed, and destroying a zvol requires confirmation.

.. _Setting Permissions:

Setting Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting permissions is an important aspect of managing data access. The
graphical administrative interface is meant to set the **initial**
permissions for a pool or dataset to make it available as a
share. Once a share is available, the client operating system is
used to fine-tune the permissions of the files and directories that
are created by the client.

:ref:`Sharing` contains configuration examples for several types of
permission scenarios. This section provides an overview of the options
available for configuring the initial set of permissions.

.. note:: For users and groups to be available, they must either be
   first created using the instructions in :ref:`Account` or imported
   from a directory service using the instructions in
   :ref:`Directory Services`. If more than 50 users or groups are
   available, the drop-down menus described in this section will
   automatically truncate their display to 50 for performance reasons.
   In this case, start to type in the desired user or group name so
   that the display narrows its search to matching results.


To set the permissions on a pool or dataset, select its entry in
:menuselection:`Storage --> Pools`, click |ui-options|, then
:guilabel:`Edit Permissions`. This displays the screen shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <storage_permissions_fig>`.
:numref:`Table %s <storage_permissions_tab>` lists the options in this
screen.

.. note:: The :guilabel:`Apply User`, :guilabel:`Apply Group`, and
   :guilabel:`Apply Mode` options allow fine-tuning of the change
   permissions behavior. By default, all three options are enabled and
   %brand% resets the :guilabel:`User`, :guilabel:`Group`, and
   :guilabel:`Mode` when the :guilabel:`Save` button is clicked. These
   options allow choosing which settings to change. For example, to
   change just the :guilabel:`Group` setting, unset the options for
   :guilabel:`Apply User` and :guilabel:`Apply Mode`.


The *Windows* :guilabel:`ACL Type` is used for
:ref:` Windows (SMB) Shares` or when the %brand% system is a member of an
Active Directory domain. This type adds ACLs to traditional Unix
permissions. When the *Windows* :guilabel:`ACL Type` is selected, ACLs
are set to the Windows defaults for new files and directories. A Windows
client can be used to further fine-tune permissions as needed. After a
pool or dataset has been set to *Windows*, it cannot be changed back to
*Unix* permissions because that would clobber the extended permissions
provided by Windows ACLs.

The *Unix* :guilabel:`ACL Type` is usually used with
:ref:`Unix (NFS) Shares`. Unix permissions are compatible with most
network clients and generally work well with a mix of operating systems
or clients. However, *Unix* permissions do not support Windows ACLs and should not
be used with:ref:` Windows (SMB) Shares`.

The *Mac* :guilabel:`ACL Type` can be used with :ref:`Apple (AFP) Shares`.

#ifdef comment
Did not have time to test View Multipaths section. To test this section
we will need to contact QA to see if they have a multipath system
available that is running the latest nightly.
#endif comment

.. _View Multipaths:

View Multipaths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

%brand% uses
`gmultipath(8) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=gmultipath>`__
to provide
`multipath I/O <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_I/O>`__
support on systems containing hardware that is capable of multipath.
An example would be a dual SAS expander backplane in the chassis or an
external JBOD.

Multipath hardware adds fault tolerance to a NAS as the data is still
available even if one disk I/O path has a failure.

%brand% automatically detects active/active and active/passive
multipath-capable hardware. Any multipath-capable devices that are
detected will be placed in multipath units with the parent devices
hidden. The configuration will be displayed in
:menuselection:`Storage --> Pools --> View Multipaths`.
Note that this option is not be displayed in the
:menuselection:`Storage --> Pools`
tree on systems that do not contain multipath-capable hardware.

.. index:: Snapshots
.. _Snapshots:

Snapshots
-------------

Snapshots are scheduled using
:menuselection:`Tasks --> Periodic Snapshot Tasks`. To view and manage
the listing of created snapshots, use
:menuselection:`Storage --> Snapshots`. An example is shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <zfs_view_avail_snapshots_fig>`.

.. note:: If snapshots do not appear, check that the current time
   configured in :ref:`Periodic Snapshot Tasks` does not conflict with
   the :guilabel:`Begin`, :guilabel:`End`, and :guilabel:`Interval`
   settings. If the snapshot was attempted but failed, an entry is
   added to :file:`/var/log/messages`. This log file can be viewed in
   :ref:`Shell`.


.. _zfs_view_avail_snapshots_fig:

.. figure:: images/storage-snapshots.png

   Viewing Available Snapshots


Each entry in the listing includes the name of the snapshot, based on
the volume/dataset name and time of the snapshot, and the amount of used
and referenced data, where:

**Used** is the amount of space consumed by this dataset and all of
its descendants. This value is checked against the dataset quota and
reservation. The space used does not include the dataset reservation,
but does take into account the reservations of any descendent datasets.
The amount of space that a dataset consumes from its parent, as well as
the amount of space freed if this dataset is recursively destroyed, is
the greater of its space used and its reservation. When a snapshot is
created, the space is initially shared between the snapshot and the
filesystem, and possibly with previous snapshots. As the filesystem
changes, space that was previously shared becomes unique to the snapshot,
and is counted in the used space of the snapshot. Deleting a snapshot can
increase the amount of space unique to, and used by, other snapshots.
The amount of space used, available, or referenced does not take into
account pending changes. While pending changes are generally accounted
for within a few seconds, disk changes do not necessarily guarantee
that the space usage information is updated immediately.


.. tip:: Space used by individual snapshots can be seen by running
   :samp:`zfs list -t snapshot` from :ref:`Shell`.


**Refer** indicates the amount of data accessible by this dataset,
which may or may not be shared with other datasets in the pool. When a
snapshot or clone is created, it initially references the same amount
of space as the filesystem or snapshot it was created from, since its
contents are identical.

To manage a snapshot, click the 3-dot icon next to its entry. The
following actions are available from that menu:

**Delete** a pop-up message asks for confirmation. Child
clones must be destroyed before their parent snapshot can be
destroyed. While creating a snapshot is instantaneous, deleting a
snapshot can be I/O intensive and can take a long time, especially
when deduplication is enabled. In order to delete a block in a
snapshot, ZFS has to walk all the allocated blocks to see if that
block is used anywhere else; if it is not, it can be freed.

**Clone** prompts for the name of the clone to create. A default name
is provided that is based upon the name of the original snapshot but
can be edited. Click the :guilabel:`Save` button to finish cloing the
snapshot.

A clone is a writable copy of the snapshot. Since a clone is actually a
dataset which can be mounted, it appears in the :guilabel:`Pools`
tab rather than the :guilabel:`Snapshots` tab. By default,
:literal:`-clone` is added to the name of a snapshot when a clone is
created.

**Rollback:** only appears on the most recent snapshot.
Clicking the icon asks for confirmation before rolling back to this
snapshot state. Confirming by clicking :guilabel:`Yes` causes any
files that have changed since the snapshot was taken to be reverted
back to their state at the time of the snapshot.

.. note:: Rollback is a potentially dangerous operation and causes
   any configured replication tasks to fail as the replication system
   uses the existing snapshot when doing an incremental backup. To
   restore the data within a snapshot, the recommended steps are:

   #.  Clone the desired snapshot.

   #.  Share the clone with the share type or service running on the
       %brand% system.

   #.  After users have recovered the needed data, destroy the clone
       in the :guilabel:`Active Pools` tab.

   This approach does not destroy any on-disk data and has no impact
   on replication.

#ifdef comment
A range of snapshots can be selected with the mouse. Click on the
option in the left column of the first snapshot, then press and hold
:kbd:`Shift` and click on the option for the end snapshot. This can
be used to select a range of obsolete snapshots to be deleted with the
:guilabel:`Destroy` icon at the bottom. Be cautious and careful when
deleting ranges of snapshots.
#endif comment

Periodic snapshots can be configured to appear as shadow copies in
newer versions of Windows Explorer, as described in
:ref:`Configuring Shadow Copies`. Users can access the files in the
shadow copy using Explorer without requiring any interaction with the
%brand% graphical administrative interface.

To quickly search through the snapshots list by name, type a matching
criteria into the :guilabel:`Filter Snapshots` text area. The listing will
change to only display the snapshot names that match the filter text.

The :guilabel:`Items per page` drop-down menu is used to reduce or
increase the amount of entries per page. Use the left or right arrows
to scroll through a multi-page listing.

.. warning:: A snapshot and any files it contains will not be accessible
   or searchable if the mount path of the snapshot is longer than 88 characters.
   The data  within the snapshot will be safe, and the snapshot will
   become accessible again when the mount path is shortened. For details
   of this limitation, and how to shorten a long mount path, see
   :ref:`Path and Name Lengths`.

.. _Browsing a Snapshot Collection:

Browsing a Snapshot Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All snapshots for a dataset are accessible as an ordinary hierarchical
filesystem, which can be reached from a hidden :file:`.zfs` file located
at the root of every dataset. A user with permission to access that file
can view and explore all snapshots for a dataset like any other files -
from the :command:`CLI` or via :menuselection:`File Sharing` services such
as :menuselection:`Samba`, :menuselection:`NFS` and :menuselection:`FTP`.
This  is an advanced capability which requires some
:command:`command line` actions to achieve. In summary, the main changes
to settings that are required are: 

* Snapshot visibility must be manually enabled in the ZFS properties of
  the dataset.

* In Samba auxillary setitngs, the :command:`veto files` command must be
  modified  to not hide the :file:`.zfs` file, and the setting
  :command:`zfsacl:expose_snapdir=true` must be added.

The effect will be that any user who can access the dataset contents, will
be able to view the list of snapshots by navigating to the
:file:`.zfs` directory of the dataset. They will also be able to browse and
search any files they have permission to access throughout the entire snapshot
collection of the dataset.
A user's ability to view files within a snapshot will be limited by any
permissions or ACLs set on the files when the snapshot was taken.
Snapshots are fixed as "read-only", so this access does not permit the
user to change any files in the snapshots, or to modify or delete any
snapshot, even if they had write permission at the time when the snapshot
was taken.

.. note:: ZFS has a :command:`zfs diff` command which can list the files
   that have changed between any two snapshot versions within a dataset,
   or between any snapshot and the current data.

.. _VMware-Snapshots:

VMware-Snapshots
----------------

:menuselection:`Storage --> VMware-Snapshots`
is used to coordinate ZFS snapshots when using %brand% as a VMware
datastore. Once this type of snapshot is created, %brand% will
automatically snapshot any running VMware virtual machines before
taking a scheduled or manual ZFS snapshot of the dataset or zvol
backing that VMware datastore. The temporary VMware snapshots are then
deleted on the VMware side but still exist in the ZFS snapshot and can
be used as stable resurrection points in that snapshot.  These
coordinated snapshots will be listed in :ref:`Snapshots`.

:numref:`Figure %s <zfs_add_vmware_snapshot_fig>`
shows the menu for adding a VMware snapshot and
:numref:`Table %s <zfs_vmware_snapshot_opts_tab>`
summarizes the available options.

The :guilabel:`Wipe` function is used to discard an unused disk.

.. warning:: Ensure all data is backed up and
   the disk is no longer in use. Triple-check that the correct disk is
   being selected to be wiped, as recovering data from a wiped disk is
   usually impossible. If there is any doubt, physically remove the
   disk, verify that all data is still present on the %brand% system,
   and wipe the disk in a separate computer.

Clicking :guilabel:`Wipe` offers several choices. *Quick* erases only
the partitioning information on a disk, making it easy to reuse but
without clearing other old data. For more security, *Full with zeros*
overwrites the entire disk with zeros, while *Full with random data*
overwrites the entire disk with random binary data.

Quick wipes take only a few seconds. A *Full with zeros* wipe of a
large disk can take several hours, and a *Full with random data* takes
longer. A progress bar is displayed during the wipe to track status.

Replacing a Failed Disk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#ifdef freenas
With any form of redundant RAID, failed drives must be replaced as
soon as possible to repair the degraded state of the RAID. Depending
on the hardware capabilities, it might be necessary to reboot to
replace the failed drive. Hardware that supports AHCI does not require
a reboot.
#endif freenas
#ifdef truenas
Replace failed drives as soon as possible to repair the degraded
state of the RAID.
#endif truenas

.. note:: Striping (RAID0) does not provide redundancy. If a disk in
   a stripe fails, the pool will be destroyed and must be recreated
   and the data restored from backup.

.. note:: If the pool is encrypted with GELI, refer to
   :ref:`Replacing an Encrypted Disk` before proceeding.


Before physically removing the failed device, go to
:menuselection:`Storage --> Pools`.
Select the pool name then click |ui-settings|. Select
:guilabel:`Status` and locate the failed disk. Then
perform these steps:

#ifdef freenas
#.  Click |ui-options| on the disk entry, then :guilabel:`Offline` to
    change the disk status to OFFLINE. This step
    removes the device from the pool and prevents swap issues.
    If the hardware supports hot-pluggable disks, click the disk
    :guilabel:`Offline` button and pull the disk, then skip to step 3.
    If there is no :guilabel:`Offline` button but only a
    :guilabel:`Replace` button, the disk is already offlined and this
    step can be skipped.
#endif freenas
#ifdef truenas
#.  Click the disk entry, then the :guilabel:`Offline` button to
    change the disk status to OFFLINE. This step
    removes the device from the pool and prevents swap issues.
    Click the disk :guilabel:`Offline` button and pull the disk. If
    there is no :guilabel:`Offline` button but only a
    :guilabel:`Replace` button, the disk is already offlined and this
    step can be skipped.
#endif truenas

    .. note:: If the process of changing the disk status to OFFLINE
       fails with a "disk offline failed - no valid replicas" message,
       the pool must be scrubbed first with the :guilabel:`Scrub Pool`
       button in
       :menuselection:`Storage --> Pools`.
       After the scrub completes, try :guilabel:`Offline` again before
       proceeding.

#ifdef freenas
#.  If the hardware is not AHCI capable, shut down the system to
    physically replace the disk. When finished, return to the GUI
    and locate the OFFLINE disk.
#endif freenas

#.  After the disk is replaced and is showing as OFFLINE, click
    |ui-options| on the disk again and then :guilabel:`Replace`.
    Select the replacement disk from the drop-down menu and click the
    :guilabel:`Replace Disk` button.  After clicking the
    :guilabel:`Replace Disk` button, the pool begins resilvering.

#. After the drive replacement process is complete, re-add the
   replaced disk in the :ref:`S.M.A.R.T. Tests` screen.

In the example shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <zfs_replace_failed_fig>`,
a failed disk is being replaced by disk *ada1* in the pool named
:file:`pool1`.


.. _zfs_replace_failed_fig:

.. figure:: images/storage-replace.png

   Replacing a Failed Disk


After the resilver is complete, :guilabel:`Pools` shows a
:guilabel:`Completed` resilver status and indicates any errors.
:numref:`Figure %s <zfs_disk_replacement_fig>`
indicates that the disk replacement was successful in this example.


.. note:: A disk that is failing but has not completely failed can be
   replaced in place, without first removing it. Whether this is a
   good idea depends on the overall condition of the failing disk. A
   disk with a few newly-bad blocks that is otherwise functional can
   be left in place during the replacement to provide data redundancy.
   A drive that is experiencing continuous errors can actually slow
   down the replacement. In extreme cases, a disk with serious
   problems might spend so much time retrying failures that it could
   prevent the replacement resilvering from completing before another
   drive fails.

   Disk Replacement is Complete


.. _Replacing an Encrypted Disk:

Replacing an Encrypted Disk
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the ZFS pool is encrypted, additional steps are needed when
replacing a failed drive.

First, make sure that a passphrase has been set using the instructions
in :ref:`Managing Encrypted Pools` **before** attempting to replace the
failed drive. Then, follow the steps 1 and 2 as described above. During
step 3, there will be a prompt to input and confirm the passphrase for
the pool. Enter this information then click the :guilabel:`Replace Disk`
button. Wait until the resilvering is complete.

Next, restore the encryption keys to the pool.
**If the following additional steps are not performed before the next
reboot, access to the pool might be permanently lost.**

#.  Highlight the pool that contains the disk that was just replaced
    and click the :guilabel:`Encryption Re-key` button in the GUI.
    Entry of the *root* password will be required.
    #ifdef truenas

    .. note:: A re-key is not allowed if :ref:`Failover`
       (High Availability) has been enabled and the standby node is
       down.
    #endif truenas

#.  Highlight the pool that contains the recently replaced disk.
    Click :guilabel:`Create Passphrase` and enter the new passphrase.
    The old passphrase can be reused if desired.

#.  Highlight the pool that contains the recently replaced disk and
    click :guilabel:`Download Key` to save the new
    encryption key. Since the old key will no longer function, any old
    keys can be safely discarded.

#.  Highlight the pool that contains the recently replaced disk
    and click :guilabel:`Add Recovery Key` to save the new
    recovery key. The old recovery key will no longer function, so it
    can be safely discarded.


.. _Removing a Log or Cache Device:

Removing a Log or Cache Device
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added log or cache devices appear in
:menuselection:`Storage --> Pools --> Pool Status`.
Clicking the device enables the :guilabel:`Replace` and
:guilabel:`Remove` buttons.

Log and cache devices can be safely removed or replaced with these
buttons. Both types of devices improve performance, and throughput can
be impacted by their removal.


.. _Replacing Disks to Grow a Pool:

Replacing Disks to Grow a Pool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The recommended method for expanding the size of a ZFS pool is to
pre-plan the number of disks in a vdev and to stripe additional vdevs
using :ref:`Pools` as additional capacity is needed.

However, this is not an option if there are no open drive ports and a
SAS/SATA HBA card cannot be added. In this case, one disk at a time
can be replaced with a larger disk, waiting for the resilvering
process to incorporate the new disk into the pool, then repeating with
another disk until all of the original disks have been replaced.

The safest way to perform this is to use a spare drive port or an
eSATA port and a hard drive dock. The process follows these steps:

#. Shut down the system.

#. Install one new disk.

#. Start up the system.

#. Go to
   :menuselection:`Storage --> Pools`,
   select the pool to expand. Click |ui-settings| then :guilabel:`Status`
   Select a disk, click |ui-options|, then :guilabel:`Replace`.
   Choose the new disk as the replacement.

#. The status of the resilver process can be viewed by running
   :command:`zpool status`. When the new disk has resilvered, the old
   one will be automatically offlined. The system is then shut down to
   physically remove the replaced disk. One advantage of this approach
   is that there is no loss of redundancy during the resilver.

If a spare drive port is not available, a drive can be replaced with a
larger one using the instructions in :ref:`Replacing a Failed Disk`.
This process is slow and places the system in a degraded state. Since
a failure at this point could be disastrous, **do not attempt this
method unless the system has a reliable backup.** Replace one drive at
a time and wait for the resilver process to complete on the replaced
drive before replacing the next drive. After all the drives are
replaced and the final resilver completes, the added space will appear
in the pool.

.. _Importing a Disk:

Importing a Disk
----------------

The :menuselection:`Pool --> Import Disk` screen, shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <zfs_import_disk_fig>`, is used to import a **single**
disk that is formatted with the UFS, NTFS, MSDOS, or EXT2
filesystem. The import is meant to be a temporary measure to copy the
data from a disk to an existing ZFS dataset. Only one disk can be
imported at a time.

.. note:: Imports of EXT3 or EXT4 filesystems are possible in some
   cases, although neither is fully supported.  EXT3 journaling is not
   supported, so those filesystems must have an external *fsck*
   utility, like the one provided by
   `E2fsprogs utilities <http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net/>`__,
   run on them before import.  EXT4 filesystems with extended
   attributes or inodes greater than 128 bytes are not supported.
   EXT4 filesystems with EXT3 journaling must have an *fsck* run on
   them before import, as described above.

   Importing a Disk


Use the drop-down menu to select the disk to import, select the type
of filesystem on the disk, and :guilabel:`Browse` to the ZFS dataset
that will hold the copied data. If the :guilabel:`MSDOSFS` filesystem
is selected, an additional :guilabel:`MSDOSFS locale` drop-down menu
will display. Use this menu to select the locale if non-ascii characters
are present on thedisk.

After clicking :guilabel:`Save`, the disk is mounted and its contents are
copied to the specified dataset. The disk is unmounted after the copy
operation completes.
