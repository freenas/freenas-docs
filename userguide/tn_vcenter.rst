==============

`vCenter Server <https://www.vmware.com/products/vcenter-server.html>`__
is server management software that uses a single console to manage a
virtual infrastructure across a hybrid cloud of physical and virtual
machines. The %brand% vCenter plugin makes it possible to provision and
use %brand% storage from within vCenter Server.

**Features:**

* Unify %brand% and other network resources with the vCenter Server
  platform.

* Use vCenter to manage %brand% datastore creation and sharing,
  storage snapshot backups, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

The %brand% vCenter plugin is available separately from %brand%.
