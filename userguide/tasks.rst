Tasks
=====

The Tasks section of the |web-ui| is used to configure
repetitive tasks:

* :ref:`Cron Jobs` schedules a command or script to automatically
  execute at a specified time

* :ref:`Init/Shutdown Scripts` configures a command or script to
  automatically execute during system startup or shutdown

* :ref:`Rsync Tasks` schedules data synchronization to another system

* :ref:`S.M.A.R.T. Tests` schedules disk tests

* :ref:`Periodic Snapshot Tasks` schedules automatic creation of
  filesystem snapshots

* :ref:`Replication Tasks` automate the replication of snapshots to
  a remote system

* :ref:`Resilver Priority` controls the priority of resilvers

* :ref:`Scrub Tasks` schedules scrubs as part of ongoing disk
  maintenance

* :ref:`Cloud Sync Tasks` schedules data synchronization to cloud
  providers

Each of these tasks is described in more detail in this section.

.. note:: By default, :ref:`Scrub Tasks` are run once a month by an
   automatically-created task. :ref:`S.M.A.R.T. Tests` and
   :ref:`Periodic Snapshot Tasks` must be set up manually.

Cron Jobs
---------

`cron(8) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=cron>`__
is a daemon that runs a command or script on a regular schedule as a
specified user.

Navigate to :menuselection:`Tasks --> Cron Jobs`
and click |ui-add| to create a cron job.

Cron jobs are shown in
:menuselection:`Tasks --> Cron Jobs`.
This table displays the user, command, description, schedule, and
whether the job is enabled. This table is adjustable by setting the
different column checkboxes above it. Set :guilabel:`Toggle` to
display all options in the table. Click |ui-options| for to show the
:guilabel:`Run Now`, :guilabel:`Edit`, and :guilabel:`Delete` options.

.. note:: :literal:`%` symbols are automatically escaped and do not
   need to be prefixed with backslashes. For example, use
   :samp:`date '+%Y-%m-%d'` in a cron job to generate a filename based
   on the date.

Scheduled commands must be in the default path. The full path to the
command can also be included in the entry. The path can be tested with
:command:`which {commandname}` in the :ref:`Shell`. When available, the
path to the command is shown:

.. code-block:: none

   [root@freenas ~]# which ls
   /bin/ls


When scheduling a script, test the script first to verify it is
executable and achieves the desired results.

.. note:: Init/shutdown scripts are run with :command:`sh`.

Init/Shutdown tasks are shown in
:menuselection:`Tasks --> Init/Shutdown Scripts`.
Click |ui-options| for a task to :guilabel:`Edit` or :guilabel:`Delete`
that task.


.. index:: Rsync Tasks
.. _Rsync Tasks:

Rsync Tasks
-----------

`Rsync <https://www.samba.org/ftp/rsync/rsync.html>`__
is a utility that copies specified data from one system to another
over a network. Once the initial data is copied, rsync reduces the
amount of data sent over the network by sending only the differences
between the source and destination files. Rsync is used for backups,
mirroring data on multiple systems, or for copying files between systems.

Rsync is most effective when only a relatively small amount
of the data has changed. There are also
`some limitations when using rsync with Windows files
<https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/impaired-rsync-permissions-support-for-windows-datasets.43973/>`__.
For large amounts of data, data that has many changes from the
previous copy, or Windows files, :ref:`Replication Tasks` are often
the faster and better solution.

Rsync is single-threaded and gains little from multiple processor cores.
To see whether rsync is currently running, use :samp:`pgrep rsync` from
the :ref:`Shell`.

Both ends of an rsync connection must be configured:

* **the rsync server:** this system pulls (receives) the data. This
  system is referred to as *PULL* in the configuration examples.

* **the rsync client:** this system pushes (sends) the data. This
  system is referred to as *PUSH* in the configuration examples.

%brand% can be configured as either an *rsync client* or an
*rsync server*. The opposite end of the connection can be another
%brand% system or any other system running rsync. In %brand% terminology,
an *rsync task* defines which data is synchronized between the two
systems. To synchronize data between two %brand% systems, create the
*rsync task* on the *rsync client*.

%brand% supports two modes of rsync operation:

* **Module:** exports a directory tree, and the configured
  settings of the tree as a symbolic name over an unencrypted connection.
  This mode requires that at least one module be defined on the rsync
  server. It can be defined in the %brand% |web-ui| under
  :menuselection:`Services --> Rsync Configure --> Rsync Module`.
  In other operating systems, the module is defined in
  `rsyncd.conf(5) <https://www.samba.org/ftp/rsync/rsyncd.conf.html>`__.

* **SSH:** synchronizes over an encrypted connection.
  Requires the configuration of SSH user and host public keys.

This section summarizes the options when creating an rsync task. It then
provides a configuration example between two %brand% systems for each
mode of rsync operation.

.. note:: If there is a firewall between the two systems or if the
   other system has a built-in firewall, make sure that TCP port 873
   is allowed.

If the rysnc server requires password authentication, enter
:samp:`--password-file={/PATHTO/FILENAME}` in the
:guilabel:`Extra options` field, replacing :literal:`/PATHTO/FILENAME`
with the appropriate path to the file containing the password.

Created rsync tasks are listed in :guilabel:`Rsync Tasks`.
Click |ui-options| for an entry to display buttons for
:guilabel:`Edit`, :guilabel:`Delete`, or :guilabel:`Run Now`.

The :guilabel:`Status` column shows the status of the rsync task. To view the
detailed rsync logs for a task, click the :guilabel:`Status` entry when the task is
running or finished.

Rsync tasks also generate an :ref:`alert` on task completion. The alert shows
if the task succeeded or failed.


.. _Rsync Module Mode:

Rsync Module Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This configuration example configures rsync module mode between
the two following %brand% systems:

* *192.168.2.2* has existing data in :file:`/mnt/local/images`. It
  will be the rsync client, meaning that an rsync task needs to be
  defined. It will be referred to as *PUSH.*

* *192.168.2.6* has an existing pool named :file:`/mnt/remote`. It
  will be the rsync server, meaning that it will receive the contents
  of :file:`/mnt/local/images`. An rsync module needs to be defined on
  this system and the rsyncd service needs to be started. It will be
  referred to as *PULL.*

On *PUSH*, an rsync task is defined in
:menuselection:`Tasks --> Rsync Tasks`, |ui-add|.
In this example:

* the :guilabel:`Path` points to :file:`/usr/local/images`, the
  directory to be copied

* the :guilabel:`Remote Host` points to *192.168.2.6*, the IP address
  of the rsync server

* the :guilabel:`Rsync Mode` is *Module*

* the :guilabel:`Remote Module Name` is *backups*; this will need to
  be defined on the rsync server

* the :guilabel:`Direction` is *Push*

* the rsync is scheduled to occur every 15 minutes

* the :guilabel:`User` is set to *root* so it has permission to write
  anywhere

* the :guilabel:`Preserve Permissions` option is enabled so that the
  original permissions are not overwritten by the *root* user

On *PULL*, an rsync module is defined in
:menuselection:`Services --> Rsync Configure --> Rsync Module`,
|ui-add|. In this example:

* the :guilabel:`Module Name` is *backups*; this needs to match the
  setting on the rsync client

* the :guilabel:`Path` is :file:`/mnt/remote`; a directory called
  :file:`images` will be created to hold the contents of
  :file:`/usr/local/images`

* the :guilabel:`User` is set to *root* so it has permission to write
  anywhere 


Descriptions of the configurable options can be found in
:ref:`Rsync Modules`.

* :guilabel:`Hosts allow` is set to *192.168.2.2*, the IP address of
  the rsync client

To finish the configuration, start the rsync service on *PULL* in
:menuselection:`Services`.
If the rsync is successful, the contents of
:file:`/mnt/local/images/` will be mirrored to
:file:`/mnt/remote/images/`.


.. _Rsync over SSH Mode:

Rsync over SSH Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SSH replication mode does not require the creation of an rsync module
or for the rsync service to be running on the rsync server. It does
require SSH to be configured before creating the rsync task:

* a public/private key pair for the rsync user account (typically
  *root*) must be generated on *PUSH* and the public key copied to the
  same user account on *PULL*

* to mitigate the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks, the public host
  key of *PULL* must be copied to *PUSH*

* the SSH service must be running on *PULL*

To create the public/private key pair for the rsync user account, open
:ref:`Shell` on *PUSH* and run :command:`ssh-keygen`. This example
generates an RSA type public/private key pair for the *root* user.
When creating the key pair, do not enter the passphrase as the key is
meant to be used for an automated task.

.. code-block:: none

 ssh-keygen -t rsa
 Generating public/private rsa key pair.
 Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
 Created directory '/root/.ssh'.
 Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
 Enter same passphrase again:
 Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
 Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
 The key fingerprint is:
 f5:b0:06:d1:33:e4:95:cf:04:aa:bb:6e:a4:b7:2b:df root@freenas.local
 The key's randomart image is:
 +--[ RSA 2048]----+
 |        .o. oo   |
 |         o+o. .  |
 |       . =o +    |
 |        + +   o  |
 |       S o .     |
 |       .o        |
 |      o.         |
 |    o oo         |
 |     **oE        |
 |-----------------|
 |                 |
 |-----------------|


%brand% supports RSA keys for SSH. When creating the key, use
:samp:`-t rsa` to specify this type of key. Refer to
`Key-based Authentication <https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/openssh.html#security-ssh-keygen>`__
for more information.

.. note:: If a different user account is used for the rsync task, use
   the :command:`su -` command after mounting the filesystem but
   before generating the key. For example, if the rsync task is
   configured to use the *user1* user account, use this command to
   become that user:

   .. code-block:: none

    su - user1


Next, view and copy the contents of the generated public key:

.. code-block:: none

 more .ssh/id_rsa.pub
 ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC1lBEXRgw1W8y8k+lXPlVR3xsmVSjtsoyIzV/PlQPo
 SrWotUQzqILq0SmUpViAAv4Ik3T8NtxXyohKmFNbBczU6tEsVGHo/2BLjvKiSHRPHc/1DX9hofcFti4h
 dcD7Y5mvU3MAEeDClt02/xoi5xS/RLxgP0R5dNrakw958Yn001sJS9VMf528fknUmasti00qmDDcp/kO
 xT+S6DFNDBy6IYQN4heqmhTPRXqPhXqcD1G+rWr/nZK4H8Ckzy+l9RaEXMRuTyQgqJB/rsRcmJX5fApd
 DmNfwrRSxLjDvUzfywnjFHlKk/+TQIT1gg1QQaj21PJD9pnDVF0AiJrWyWnR root@freenas.local


Go to *PULL* and paste (or append) the copied key into the
:guilabel:`SSH Public Key` field of
:menuselection:`Accounts --> Users --> root -->`
|ui-options|
:menuselection:`--> Edit`,
or the username of the specified rsync user account. The paste for the
above example is shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <tasks_pasting_sshkey_fig>`.
When pasting the key, ensure that it is pasted as one long line and,
if necessary, remove any extra spaces representing line breaks.

.. _tasks_pasting_sshkey_fig:

.. figure:: %imgpath%/accounts-users-edit-ssh-key.png

   Pasting the User SSH Public Key


While on *PULL*, verify that the SSH service is running in
:menuselection:`Services` and start it if it is not.

Next, copy the host key of *PULL* using Shell on *PUSH*. The
command copies the RSA host key of the *PULL* server used in our
previous example. Be sure to include the double bracket *>>* to
prevent overwriting any existing entries in the :file:`known_hosts`
file:

.. code-block:: none

 ssh-keyscan -t rsa 192.168.2.6 >> /root/.ssh/known_hosts


.. note:: If *PUSH* is a Linux system, use this command to copy the
   RSA key to the Linux system:

   .. code-block:: none

      cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@192.168.2.6 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'


The rsync task can now be created on *PUSH*. To configure rsync SSH
mode using the systems in our previous example, the configuration is:

* the :guilabel:`Path` points to :file:`/mnt/local/images`, the
  directory to be copied

* the :guilabel:`Remote Host` points to *192.168.2.6*, the IP address
  of the rsync server

* the :guilabel:`Rsync Mode` is *SSH*

* the rsync is scheduled to occur every 15 minutes

* the :guilabel:`User` is set to *root* so it has permission to write
  anywhere; the public key for this user must be generated on *PUSH*
  and copied to *PULL*

* the :guilabel:`Preserve Permissions` option is enabled so that the
  original permissions are not overwritten by the *root* user

Save the rsync task and the rsync will automatically occur according
to the schedule. In this example, the contents of
:file:`/mnt/local/images/` will automatically appear in
:file:`/mnt/remote/images/` after 15 minutes. If the content does not
appear, use Shell on *PULL* to read :file:`/var/log/messages`. If the
message indicates a *\n* (newline character) in the key, remove the
space in the pasted key--it will be after the character that appears
just before the *\n* in the error message.

S.M.A.R.T. Tests
----------------

`S.M.A.R.T. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.>`__
(Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) is a monitoring
system for computer hard disk drives to detect and report on various
indicators of reliability. Replace the drive when a failure is
anticipated by S.M.A.R.T. Most modern ATA, IDE, and
SCSI-3 hard drives support S.M.A.R.T. -- refer to the drive
documentation for confirmation.

Click :menuselection:`Tasks --> S.M.A.R.T. Tests`
and |ui-add| to add a new scheduled S.M.A.R.T. test.
:numref:`Figure %s <tasks_add_smart_test_fig>`
shows the configuration screen that appears. Tests are listed under
:guilabel:`S.M.A.R.T. Tests`. After creating tests, check the
configuration in
:menuselection:`Services --> S.M.A.R.T.`,
then click the power button for the S.M.A.R.T. service in
:menuselection:`Services`
to activate the service. The S.M.A.R.T. service will not start if there
are no pools.

.. note:: To prevent problems, do not enable the S.M.A.R.T. service if
   the disks are controlled by a RAID controller. It is the job of the
   controller to monitor S.M.A.R.T. and mark drives as Predictive
   Failure when they trip.

once a week and a :guilabel:`Long Self-Test` once a month. These tests
do not have a performance impact, as the disks prioritize normal
I/O over the tests. If a disk fails a test, even if the overall status
is *Passed*, consider replacing that disk.

.. warning:: Some S.M.A.R.T. tests cause heavy disk activity and
   can drastically reduce disk performance. Do not schedule S.M.A.R.T.
   tests to run at the same time as scrub or resilver operations or
   during other periods of intense disk activity.


Which tests will run and when can be verified by typing
:command:`smartd -q showtests` within :ref:`Shell`.

The results of a test can be checked from :ref:`Shell` by specifying
the name of the drive. For example, to see the results for disk
*ada0*, type:

.. code-block:: none

  smartctl -l selftest /dev/ada0

Periodic Snapshot Tasks
-----------------------

A periodic snapshot task allows scheduling the creation of read-only
versions of pools and datasets at a given point in time. Snapshots can
be created quickly and, if little data changes, new snapshots take up
very little space. For example, a snapshot where no files have changed
takes 0 MB of storage, but as changes are made to files, the snapshot
size changes to reflect the size of the changes.

Snapshots keep a history of files,
providing a way to recover an older copy or even a deleted file. For
this reason, many administrators take snapshots often,
store them for a period of time,
and store them on another system, typically using
:ref:`Replication Tasks`. Such a strategy allows the administrator to
roll the system back to a specific point in time. If there is a
catastrophic loss, an off-site snapshot can be used to restore the
system up to the time of the last snapshot.

A pool must exist before a snapshot can be created. Creating a pool is
described in :ref:`Pools`.

View the list of periodic snapshot tasks by going to
:menuselection:`Tasks --> Periodic Snapshot Tasks`. If a periodic
snapshot task encounters an error, the status column will show
*ERROR*. Click the status to view the logs of the task.

To create a periodic snapshot task, navigate to
:menuselection:`Tasks --> Periodic Snapshot Tasks`
and click |ui-add|. This opens the screen shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <zfs_periodic_snapshot_fig>`.
:numref:`Table %s <zfs_periodic_snapshot_opts_tab>`
describes the fields in this screen.

Setting :guilabel:`Recursive` adds child datasets to the snapshot.
Creating separate snapshots for each child dataset is not needed.

Click :guilabel:`SAVE` when finished customizing the task. Defined tasks
are listed alphabetically in
:menuselection:`Tasks --> Periodic Snapshot Tasks`.

Click |ui-options| for a periodic snapshot task to see options to
:guilabel:`Edit` or :guilabel:`Delete` the scheduled task.

Deleting a dataset does not delete snapshot tasks for that dataset.
To re-use the snapshot task for a different dataset, :guilabel:`Edit`
the task and choose the new :guilabel:`Dataset`. The original dataset
is shown in the drop-down, but cannot be selected.

Deleting the last periodic snapshot task used by a replication task is
not permitted while that replication task remains active. The
replication task must be disabled before the related periodic snapshot
task can be deleted.


.. index:: Replication
.. _Replication:

Replication
-----------

*Replication* is the process of copying
:ref:`ZFS dataset snapshots <ZFS Primer>` from one storage pool to
another. Replications can be configured to copy snapshots to another
pool on the local system or send copies to a remote system that is in
a different physical location.

Replication schedules are typically paired with
:ref:`Periodic Snapshot Tasks` to generate local copies of important
data and replicate these copies to a remote system.

Replications require a source system with dataset snapshots and a
destination that can store the copied data. Remote replications require
a saved :ref:`SSH Connection <SSH Connections>` on the source system and
the destination system must be configured to allow :ref:`SSH`
connections. Local replications do not use SSH.

Snapshots are organized and sent to the destination according to the
creation date included in the snapshot name. When replicating manually
created snapshots, make sure snapshots are named according to their
actual creation date.

First-time replication tasks can take a long time to complete as the
entire dataset snapshot must be copied to the destination system.
Replicated data is not visible on the receiving system until the
replication task is complete.

Later replications only send incremental snapshot changes to the
destination system. This reduces both the total space required by
replicated data and the network bandwidth required for the replication
to complete.

The replication task asks to destroy destination dataset snapshots when
those snapshots are not related to the replication snapshots. Verify
that the snapshots in the destination dataset are unneeded or are backed
up in a different location! Allowing the replication task to continue
destroys the current snapshots in the destination dataset and replicates
a full copy of the source snapshots.

The target dataset on the destination system is created in *read-only*
mode to protect the data. To mount or browse the data on the destination
system, use a clone of the snapshot. Clones are created in *read/write*
mode, making it possible to browse or mount them. See :ref:`Snapshots`
for more details.

Replications run in parallel as long as they do not conflict with each
other. Completion time depends on the number and size of snapshots and
the bandwidth available between the source and destination computers.

Examples in this section refer to the %brand% system with the original
datasets for snapshot and replication as |rpln-sys1| and the %brand%
system that is storing replicated snapshots as |rpln-sys2|.


.. index:: Replication Creation Wizard
.. _Replication Creation Wizard:

Replication Creation Wizard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new replication, go to
:menuselection:`Tasks --> Replication Tasks`
and click |ui-add|.

.. _tasks_replication_wizard_fig:

.. figure:: %imgpath%/tasks-replication-add-wizard-step1.png

   Replication Wizard: What and Where


The wizard allows loading previously saved replication configurations
and simplifies many replication settings. To see all possible
:ref:`replication creation options <Advanced Replication Creation>`,
click :guilabel:`ADVANCED REPLICATION CREATION`.

Using the wizard to create a new replication task begins by defining
what is being replicated and where. Choosing *On a Different System* for
either the :guilabel:`Sources Datasets` or
:guilabel:`Destination Dataset` requires an
:ref:`SSH Connection <SSH Connections>` to the remote system. Open the
drop-down menu to choose an SSH connection or click *Create New* to add
a new connection.

To choose a dataset, click |ui-browse| and select the dataset from the
expandable tree. The path of the dataset can also be typed into the
field. Multiple :guilabel:`Source Datasets` can be chosen.

Start by selecting the :guilabel:`Source Datasets` to be replicated.
Source datasets on the local system are replicated using existing
snapshots of the chosen datasets. When no snapshots exist, %brand%
automatically creates snapshots of the chosen datasets before starting
the replication. To manually define which dataset snapshots to
replicate, set :guilabel:`Replicate Custom Snapshots` and define a
snapshot :guilabel:`Naming Schema`.

Source datasets on a remote system are replicated by defining a
snapshot :guilabel:`Naming Schema`. The schema is a pattern of the name
and `strftime(3) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=strftime>`__
*%Y*, *%m*, *%d*, *%H*, and *%M* strings that match names of the
snapshots to include in the replication. For example, to replicate
a snapshot named :samp:`auto-2019-12-18.05-20-2w` from a remote source,
enter :samp:`auto-%Y-%m-%d.%H-%M-2w` as the replication task
:guilabel:`Naming Schema`.

The number of snapshots that will be replicated is shown. There is also
a :guilabel:`Recursive` option to include child datasets with the
selected datasets.

Now choose the :guilabel:`Destination Dataset` to receive the replicated
snapshots. Only a single dataset can be chosen.

Using an SSH connection for replication adds the
:guilabel:`SSH Transfer Security` option. This sets the data transfer
security level. The connection is authenticated with SSH. Data can be
encrypted during transfer for security or left unencrypted to maximize
transfer speed. **WARNING:** Encryption is recommended, but can be
disabled for increased speed on secure networks.

A suggested replication :guilabel:`Task Name` is shown. This can be
changed to give a more meaningful name to the task. When the source and
destination have been set, click :guilabel:`NEXT` to choose when the
replication will run.

.. _tasks_replication_wizard_screen2_fig:

.. figure:: %imgpath%/tasks-replication-add-wizard-step2.png

   Replication Wizard: When


The replication task can be configured to run on a schedule or left
unscheduled and manually activated. Choosing *Run On a Schedule* adds
the :guilabel:`Scheduling` drop-down to choose from preset schedules or
define a *Custom* replication schedule. Choosing *Run Once* removes all
scheduling options.

:guilabel:`Destination Snapshot Lifetime` determines when replicated
snapshots are deleted from the destination system:

 * *Same as Source*: duplicate the configured *Snapshot Lifetime*
   value from the source dataset
   :ref:`periodic snapshot task <Periodic Snapshot Tasks>`.

 * *Never Delete*: never delete snapshots from the destination system.

 * *Custom*: define how long a snapshot remains on the destination
   system. Enter a number and choose a measure of time from the
   drop-down menus.

Clicking :guilabel:`START REPLICATION` saves the replication
configuration and activates the schedule. When the replication
configuration includes a source dataset on the local system and has a
schedule, a :ref:`periodic snapshot task <Periodic Snapshot Tasks>` of
that dataset is also created.

Tasks set to *Run Once* will start immediately. If a one-time
replication has no valid local system source dataset snapshots,
%brand% will snapshot the source datasets and immediately replicate
those snapshots to the destination dataset.

All replication tasks are displayed in
:menuselection:`Tasks --> Replication Tasks`.
The task settings that are shown by default can be adjusted by opening
the :guilabel:`COLUMNS` drop-down. To see more details about the last
time the replication task ran, click the entry under the
:guilabel:`State` column. Tasks can also be expanded by clicking
|ui-chevron-right| for that task. Expanded tasks show all replication
settings and have |ui-task-run|, |ui-edit|, and |ui-delete| buttons.


.. index:: Advanced Replication Creation
.. _Advanced Replication Creation:

Advanced Replication Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The advanced replication creation screen has more options for
fine-tuning a replication. It also allows creating local replications,
legacy engine replications from %brand% 11.1 or earlier, or even
creating a one-time replication that is not linked to a periodic
snapshot task.

Go to
:menuselection:`System --> Replication Tasks`,
click |ui-add| and :guilabel:`ADVANCED REPLICATION CREATION` to see
these options. This screen is also displayed after clicking |ui-options|
and :guilabel:`Edit` for an existing replication.

The replication name and configuration details are shown in the list.
To adjust the default table view, open the :guilabel:`COLUMNS` menu and
select the replication details to show in the normal table view.

The :guilabel:`State` column shows the status of the replication task.
To view the detailed replication logs for a task, click the
:guilabel:`State` entry when the task is running or finished.

Expanding an entry shows additional buttons for starting or editing a
replication task.


.. _Limiting Replication Times:

Limiting Replication Times
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Schedule`, :guilabel:`Begin`, and :guilabel:`End` times
in a replication task make it possible to restrict when replication is
allowed. These times can be set to only allow replication after business
hours, or at other times when disk or network activity will not slow
down other operations like snapshots or :ref:`Scrub Tasks`. The default
settings allow replication to occur at any time.

These times control when replication task are allowed to start, but
will not stop a replication task that is already running. Once a
replication task has begun, it will run until finished.

.. _Replication Topolgies and Scenarios:

Replication Topologies and Scenarios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The replication examples shown above are known as *simple* or *A to B*
replication, where one machine replicates data to one other machine.
Replication can also be set up in more sophisticated topologies to
suit various purposes and needs.


.. _Star Replication:

Star Replication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a *star* topology, a single %brand% computer replicates data to
multiple destination computers. This provides data redundancy with
the multiple copies of data, and geographical redundancy if the
destination computers are located at different sites.

An *Alpha* computer with three separate replication tasks to replicate
data to *Beta*, then *Gamma*, and finally *Delta* computers
demonstrates this arrangement. *A to B* replication is really just a
star arrangement with only one target computer.

The star topology is simple to configure and manage, but it can place
relatively high I/O and network loads on the source computer, which
must run an individual replication task for each target computer.


Tiered Replication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In *tiered* replication, the data is replicated from the source
computer onto one or a few destination computers. The destination
computers then replicate the same data onto other computers. This
allows much of the network and I/O load to be shifted away from the
source computer.

For example, consider both *Alpha* and *Beta* computers to be located
inside the same data center. Replicating data from *Alpha* to *Beta*
does not protect that data from events that would involve the whole
data center, like flood, fire, or earthquake. Two more computers,
called *Gamma* and *Delta*, are set up. To provide geographic
redundancy, *Gamma* is in a data center on the other side of the
country, and *Delta* is in a data center on another continent. A
single periodic snapshot replicates data from *Alpha* to *Beta*.
*Beta* then replicates the data onto *Gamma*, and again onto *Delta*.

Tiered replication shifts most of the network and I/O overhead of
repeated replication off the source computer onto the target
computers. The source computer only replicates to the second-tier
computers, which then handle replication to the third tier, and so on.
In this example, *Alpha* only replicates data onto *Beta*. The I/O and
network load of repeated replications is shifted onto *Beta*.


N-way Replication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*N-way* replication topologies recognize that hardware is sometimes
idle, and computers can be used for more than a single dedicated
purpose. An individual computer can be used as both a source and
destination for replication. For example, the *Alpha* system can
replicate a dataset to *Beta*, while *Beta* can replicate datasets to
both *Alpha* and *Gamma*.

With careful setup, this topology can efficiently use I/O, network
bandwidth, and computers, but can quickly become complex to manage.


Disaster Recovery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Disaster recovery* is the ability to recover complete datasets from a
replication destination computer. The replicated dataset is replicated
back to new hardware after an incident caused the source computer to
fail.

Recovering data onto a replacement computer is done manually with
the :command:`zfs send` and :command:`zfs recv` commands, or a
replication task can be defined on the target computer containing the
backup data. This replication task would normally be disabled.
If a disaster damages the source computer, the target computer
replication task is temporarily enabled, replicating the data onto the
replacement source computer. After the disaster recovery replication
completes, the replication task on the target computer is disabled
again.

.. _Troubleshooting Replication:

Troubleshooting Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replication depends on SSH, disks, network, compression, and
encryption to work. A failure or misconfiguration of any of these can
prevent successful replication.

Replication logs are saved in :file:`var/log/zettarepl.log`. Logs of
individual replication tasks can be viewed by clicking the replication
:guilabel:`State`.


SSH
^^^

:ref:`SSH` must be able to connect from the source system to the
destination system with an encryption key. This is tested from
:ref:`Shell` by making an :ref:`SSH` connection from the source
system to the destination system. For example, this is a connection from
*Alpha* to *Beta* at *10.0.0.118*. Start the :ref:`Shell` on the source
machine (*Alpha*), then enter this command:

.. code-block:: none

   ssh -vv 10.0.0.118


On the first connection, the system might say

.. code-block:: none

   No matching host key fingerprint found in DNS.
   Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?


Verify that this is the correct destination computer from the
preceding information on the screen and type :literal:`yes`. At this
point, an :ref:`SSH` shell connection is open to the destination
system, *Beta*.

If a password is requested, SSH authentication is not working. An
SSH key value must be present in the destination system
:file:`/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. :file:`/var/log/auth.log`
file can show diagnostic errors for login problems on the destination
computer also.


Compression
^^^^^^^^^^^

Matching compression and decompression programs must be available on
both the source and destination computers. This is not a problem when
both computers are running %brand%, but other operating systems might
not have *lz4*, *pigz*, or *plzip* compression programs installed by
default. An easy way to diagnose the problem is to set
:guilabel:`Replication Stream Compression` to *Off*. If the
replication runs, select the preferred compression method and check
:file:`/var/log/debug.log` on the %brand% system for errors.


Manual Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On *Alpha*, the source computer, the :file:`/var/log/messages` file
can also show helpful messages to locate the problem.

On the source computer, *Alpha*, open a :ref:`Shell` and manually send
a single snapshot to the destination computer, *Beta*. The snapshot
used in this example is named :file:`auto-20161206.1110-2w`. As
before, it is located in the *alphapool/alphadata* dataset. A
:literal:`@` symbol separates the name of the dataset from the name of
the snapshot in the command.


.. code-block:: none

   zfs send alphapool/alphadata@auto-20161206.1110-2w | ssh 10.0.0.118 zfs recv betapool


If a snapshot of that name already exists on the destination computer,
the system will refuse to overwrite it with the new snapshot. The
existing snapshot on the destination computer can be deleted by
opening a :ref:`Shell` on *Beta* and running this command:


.. code-block:: none

   zfs destroy -R betapool/alphadata@auto-20161206.1110-2w


Then send the snapshot manually again. Snapshots on the destination
system, *Beta*, are listed from the :ref:`Shell` with
:samp:`zfs list -t snapshot` or from
:menuselection:`Storage --> Snapshots`.

Error messages here can indicate any remaining problems.

-----------------

Resilvering, or the process of copying data to a replacement disk, is
best completed as quickly as possible. Increasing the priority of
resilvers can help them to complete more quickly. The
:guilabel:`Resilver Priority` menu makes it possible to increase the
priority of resilvering at times where the additional I/O or CPU usage
will not affect normal usage. Select

.. index:: Scrub
.. _Scrub Tasks:

Scrub Tasks
-----------

A scrub is the process of ZFS scanning through the data on a pool.
Scrubs help to identify data integrity problems, detect silent data
corruptions caused by transient hardware issues, and provide early
alerts of impending disk failures. %brand% makes it easy to schedule
periodic automatic scrubs.

It is recommneded that each pool is scrubbed at least once a month. Bit
errors in critical data can be detected by ZFS, but only when that data
is read. Scheduled scrubs can find bit errors in rarely-read data. The
amount of time needed for a scrub is proportional to the quantity of
data on the pool. Typical scrubs take several hours or longer.

The scrub process is I/O intensive and can negatively impact
performance. Schedule scrubs for evenings or weekends to minimize
impact to users. Make certain that scrubs and other disk-intensive
activity like :ref:`S.M.A.R.T. Tests` are scheduled to run on
different days to avoid disk contention and extreme performance
impacts.

Scrubs only check used disk space. To check unused disk space,
schedule :ref:`S.M.A.R.T. Tests` of :guilabel:`Type` *Long Self-Test*
to run once or twice a month.

Scrubs are scheduled and managed with
:menuselection:`Tasks --> Scrub Tasks`.

When a pool is created, a scrub is automatically scheduled. An entry
with the same pool name is added to
:menuselection:`Tasks --> Scrub Tasks`.
A summary of this entry can be viewed with
:menuselection:`Tasks --> Scrub Tasks`.
:numref:`Figure %s <zfs_view_volume_scrub_fig>`
displays the default settings for the pool named :file:`pool1`. In
this example, |ui-options| and :guilabel:`Edit` for a pool is clicked to
display the :guilabel:`Edit` screen.
:numref:`Table %s <zfs_scrub_opts_tab>` summarizes the options in this
screen.

Review the default selections and, if necessary, modify them to meet
the needs of the environment. Scrub tasks cannot run for locked or
unmounted pools.

Scheduled scrubs can be deleted with the :guilabel:`Delete` button,
but this is not recommended. **Scrubs can provide an early indication
of disk issues before a disk failure.** If a scrub is too intensive
for the hardware, consider temporarily deselecting the
:guilabel:`Enabled` button for the scrub until the hardware can be
upgraded.

Cloud Sync Tasks
----------------

Files or directories can be synchronized to remote cloud storage
providers with the :guilabel:`Cloud Sync Tasks` feature.

.. warning:: This Cloud Sync task might go to a third party
   commercial vendor not directly affiliated with iXsystems. Please
   investigate and fully understand that vendor's pricing policies and
   services before creating any Cloud Sync task. iXsystems is not
   responsible for any charges incurred from the use of third party
   vendors with the Cloud Sync feature.


:ref:`Cloud Credentials` must be defined before a cloud sync is
created. One set of credentials can be used for more than one cloud
sync. For example, a single set of credentials for Amazon S3 can be
used for separate cloud syncs that push different sets of files or
directories.

A cloud storage area must also exist. With Amazon S3, these are called
*buckets*. The bucket must be created before a sync task can be
created.

After the cloud credentials have been configured,
:menuselection:`Tasks --> Cloud Sync Tasks` is used to define the
schedule for running a cloud sync task. The time selected is when the
Cloud Sync task is allowed to begin. An in-progress cloud sync must
complete before another cloud sync can start. The cloud sync runs until
finished, even after the selected ending time. To stop the cloud sync
task before it is finished, click
|ui-options| :menuselection:`--> Stop`.

An example is shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <tasks_cloudsync_status_fig>`.

.. _tasks_cloudsync_status_fig:

   Cloud Sync Status


The cloud sync :guilabel:`Status` indicates the state of most recent
cloud sync. Clicking the :guilabel:`Status` entry shows the task logs
and includes an option to download them.

Click |ui-add| to display the :guilabel:`Add Cloud Sync` menu shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <tasks_cloudsync_add_fig>`.

.. _sync task notes:

There are specific circumstances where a *SYNC* task does not delete
files from the destination:

* If `rclone sync <https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/>`__
  encounters any errors, files are not deleted in the destination.
  This includes a common error when the Dropbox
  `copyright detector <https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/30/how-dropbox-knows-when-youre-sharing-copyrighted-stuff-without-actually-looking-at-your-stuff/>`__
  flags a file as copyrighted.

* Syncing to a :ref:`B2 bucket <cloud_cred_tab>` does not delete files
  from the bucket, even when those files have been deleted locally.
  Instead, files are tagged with a version number or moved to a hidden
  state. To automatically delete old or unwanted files from the bucket,
  adjust the
  `Backblaze B2 Lifecycle Rules <https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-b2-lifecycle-rules/>`__

* Files stored in Amazon S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive cannot be
  deleted by
  `rclone sync <https://rclone.org/s3/#glacier-and-glacier-deep-archive/>`__.
  These files must first be restored by another means, like the
  `Amazon S3 console <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/restore-archived-objects.html>`__.

To modify an existing cloud sync, click |ui-options| to access the
:guilabel:`Run Now`, :guilabel:`Edit`, and :guilabel:`Delete` options.


.. _Cloud Sync Example:

Cloud Sync Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows a *Push* cloud sync that copies files from a %brand%
pool to a cloud service provider.

The cloud service provider was configured with a location to store data
received from the %brand% system.

In the %brand% |web-ui|, go to
:menuselection:`System --> Cloud Credentials`
and click |ui-add| to configure the cloud service provider credentials:

.. _tasks_cloudsync_example_cred_fig:

.. figure:: %imgpath%/system-cloud-credentials-add-example.png

   Example: Adding Cloud Credentials


Go to
:menuselection:`Tasks --> Cloud Sync`
and click |ui-add| to create a cloud sync job. The
:guilabel:`Description` is filled with a simple note describing the job.
Data is being sent to cloud storage, so this is a *Push*. The provider
comes from the cloud credentials defined in the previous step, and the
destination folder was configured in the cloud provider account.

The :guilabel:`Directory/Files` is set to the file or directory to copy
to the cloud provider.

The :guilabel:`Transfer Mode` is set to *COPY* so that only the files
stored by the cloud provider are modified.

The remaining requirement is to schedule the task. The default is to
send the data to cloud storage daily, but the schedule can be
:ref:`customized <Advanced Scheduler>` to fine-tune when the task runs.

The :guilabel:`Enabled` field is enabled by default, so this cloud
sync will run at the next scheduled time.

An example of a completed cloud sync task is shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <tasks_cloudsync_example_fig>`:
