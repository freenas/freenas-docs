If a scrub or resilver is running, a warning is shown. Clicking
:guilabel:`Cancel` is reocommended. :command:`zpool status` can be

complete. Then the system can be shut down normally.

Check the :guilabel:`Confirm` check box and click the
:guilabel:`Shutdown` button to shutdown the system. Shutting down the
system disconnects all clients, including the web administration GUI.
