Virtual Machines
================

A Virtual Machine (*VM*) is an environment on a host computer that
can be used as if it were a separate physical computer. VMs can be
used to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single
computer. Operating systems running inside a VM see emulated virtual
hardware rather than the actual hardware of the host computer. This
provides more isolation than :ref:`Jails`, although there is
additional overhead. A portion of system RAM is assigned to each VM,
and each VM uses a :ref:`zvol <Adding Zvols>` for storage. While a VM
is running, these resources are not available to the host computer or
other VMs.

%brand% VMs use the
`bhyve(8) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bhyve>`__
virtual machine software. This type of virtualization requires an
Intel processor with Extended Page Tables (EPT) or an AMD processor
with Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI) or Nested Page Tables (NPT).

To verify that an Intel processor has the required features, use
:ref:`Shell` to run :samp:`grep VT-x /var/run/dmesg.boot`. If the
*EPT* and *UG* features are shown, this processor can be used with
*bhyve*.

To verify that an AMD processor has the required features, use
:ref:`Shell` to run :command:`grep POPCNT /var/run/dmesg.boot`. If the
output shows the POPCNT feature, this processor can be used with
*bhyve*.


.. note:: By default, new VMs have the
   `bhyve(8) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bhyve>`__
   :literal:`-H` option set. This causes the virtual CPU thread to
   yield when a HLT instruction is detected, and prevents idle VMs
   from consuming all of the host's CPU.


.. note:: AMD K10 "Kuma" processors include POPCNT but do not support
   NRIPS, which is required for use with bhyve. Production of these
   processors ceased in 2012 or 2013.

   Binary-copy the disk image data into the :ref:`zvol <Adding Zvols>`
   created for the %brand% VM with a tool that operates at the level
   of disk blocks, like
   `dd(1) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dd>`__.
   For some VM systems, it is best to back up data, install the
   operating system from scratch in a new %brand% VM, and restore the
   data into the new VM.


.. _vms-network-interface:

NIC (Network Interfaces)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:numref:`Figure %s <vms-nic_fig>` shows the fields that appear after
going to
:menuselection:`Virtual Machines -->` |ui-options| :menuselection:`--> Devices`,
clicking |ui-add|, and selecting :guilabel:`NIC` as the
:guilabel:`Type`.

.. _vms-nic_fig:

.. figure:: images/virtual-machines-devices-nic.png

   Network Interface Device


The :guilabel:`Adapter Type` can emulate an Intel e82545 (e1000)
Ethernet card for compatibility with most operating systems. *VirtIO*
can provide better performance when the operating system installed in
the VM supports VirtIO paravirtualized network drivers.

By default, the VM receives an auto-generated random MAC address. To
override the default with a custom value, enter the desired address
in :guilabel:`MAC Address`. Click :guilabel:`GENERATE MAC ADDRESS` to
automatically populate :guilabel:`MAC Address` with a new randomized
MAC address.

If the system has multiple physical network interface cards, use the
:guilabel:`NIC to attach` drop-down menu to specify which
physical interface to associate with the VM.

Set a :guilabel:`Device Order` number to determine the boot order of
this device. A lower number means a higher boot priority.


.. _vms-disk-device:

Disk Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Zvols <adding zvols>` are typically used as virtual hard drives.
After :ref:`creating a zvol <adding zvols>`, associate it with the VM
by clicking
:menuselection:`Virtual Machines -->` |ui-options| :menuselection:`--> Devices`,
clicking |ui-add|, and selecting :guilabel:`Disk` as the
:guilabel:`Type`.

.. figure:: images/virtual-machines-devices-disk.png

   Disk Device


Open the drop-down menu to select a created :guilabel:`Zvol`, then set
the disk :guilabel:`Mode`:

* *AHCI* emulates an AHCI hard disk for best software compatibility.

* *VirtIO* uses paravirtualized drivers and can provide better
  performance, but requires the operating system installed in the VM to
  support VirtIO disk devices.

If a specific sector size is required, enter the number of bytes in
:guilabel:`Disk sector size`. The default of *0* uses an autotune script
to determine the best sector size for the zvol.

Set a :guilabel:`Device Order` number to determine the boot order of
this device. A lower number means a higher boot priority.


.. _vms-raw-file:

Raw Files
~~~~~~~~~

*Raw Files* are similar to :ref:`Zvol <Adding Zvols>` disk devices,
but the disk image comes from a file. These are typically used with
existing read-only binary images of drives, like an installer disk
image file meant to be copied onto a USB stick.

After obtaining and copying the image file to the %brand% system,
click
:menuselection:`Virtual Machines -->` |ui-options| :menuselection:`--> Devices`,
click |ui-add|, then set the :guilabel:`Type` to :guilabel:`Raw File`.

.. figure:: images/virtual-machines-devices-rawfile.png

   Raw File Disk Device


:guilabel:`Browse` to select the image file. If a specific sector size
is required, enter the number of bytes in :guilabel:`Disk sector size`.
The default value of *0* uses an autotuner to find and set the best
sector size for the file.

Setting the disk :guilabel:`Mode` to *AHCI* emulates an AHCI hard disk
for best software compatibility. *VirtIO* uses paravirtualized drivers
and can provide better performance, but requires the operating system
installed in the VM to support VirtIO disk devices.

Set a :guilabel:`Device Order` number to determine the boot order of
this device. A lower number means a higher boot priority.


.. _vms-VNC:

VNC Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VMs set to *UEFI* booting are also given a VNC (Virtual Network
Computing) remote connection. A standard
`VNC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing>`__
client can connect to the VM to provide screen output and keyboard and
mouse input.

.. note:: Each VM can only have a single VNC device. An existing VNC
   interface can be changed by clicking |ui-options| and
   :guilabel:`Edit`.


.. note:: :ref:`Docker Hosts <Docker Hosts>` are not compatible with VNC
   connections and cannot have a VNC interface.


.. note:: Using a non-US keyboard via VNC is not yet supported. As a
   workaround, select the US keymap on the system running the VNC client,
   then configure the operating system running in the VM to use a
   keymap that matches the physical keyboard. This will enable passthrough
   of all keys regardless of the keyboard layout.


:numref:`Figure %s <vms-vnc_fig>` shows the fields that appear
after going to
:menuselection:`Virtual Machines -->` |ui-options| :menuselection:`--> Devices`,
and clicking
|ui-options| :menuselection:`--> Edit`
for VNC.

.. _vms-vnc_fig:

.. figure:: images/virtual-machines-devices-vnc.png

   VNC Device


The :guilabel:`Port` can be set to *0*, left empty for %brand% to
assign a port when the VM is started, or set to a fixed, preferred
port number.

Set :guilabel:`Wait to boot` to force the VNC client to wait
until the VM has booted before attempting the connection.

Use the :guilabel:`Resolution` drop-down menu to
choose the default screen resolution used by the VNC session.

Select the IP address for VNC to listen on with the
:guilabel:`Bind` drop-down menu.

To automatically pass the VNC password, enter it into the
:guilabel:`Password` field. Note that the password is limited to 8
characters.

To use the VNC web interface, set :guilabel:`Web Interface`.

.. tip:: If a RealVNC 5.X Client shows the error
   :literal:`RFB protocol error: invalid message type`, disable the
   :guilabel:`Adapt to network speed` option and move the slider to
   :guilabel:`Best quality`. On later versions of RealVNC, select
   :menuselection:`File --> Preferences`,
   click :guilabel:`Expert`, :guilabel:`ProtocolVersion`, then
   select 4.1 from the drop-down menu.


Set a :guilabel:`Device Order` number to determine the boot order of
this device. A lower number means a higher boot priority.

.. _vms-virtual-serial:

Virtual Serial Ports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VMs automatically include a virtual serial port.

* :file:`/dev/nmdm1B` is assigned to the first VM

* :file:`/dev/nmdm2B` is assigned to the second VM

These virtual serial ports allow connecting to the VM
console from the :ref:`Shell`.

.. tip:: The `nmdm <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=nmdm>`__
   device is dynamically created. The actual :literal:`nmdm` name can
   differ on each system.


To connect to the first VM:

.. code-block:: none

   cu -l /dev/nmdm1B -s 9600


See
`cu(1) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=cu>`__
for more information on using :command:`cu`.


.. index:: Running VMs
.. _Running VMs:

Running VMs
-----------

Go to
:menuselection:`Virtual Machines`
to see a card for each installed VM. There are different view options at
the top of the screen for this page:

* :guilabel:`Cards`: Default view. Shows a large "card" for each VM with
  all options for that VM contained on that card.

* :guilabel:`Slim`: Similar to the default, but reduces card size to fit
  more cards on the screen.

* :guilabel:`Table`: Removes cards entirely to show all VMs in a space
  efficient table. This view also has a
  :guilabel:`Virtual Machines Summary` which displays VM memory usage.


The default :guilabel:`Cards` view is described and shown in this
section, but VM options are the same between each view. Each VM card has
a :guilabel:`CONNECT` button at the bottom and will flip to show more
options after clicking |ui-options| and :guilabel:`Edit`.

.. figure:: images/virtual-machines.png

   VM Cards


The name, description, running state, com port (if present), and other
configuration values are shown on the card. Click |ui-options| for the
:guilabel:`Start`, :guilabel:`Stop`, :guilabel:`Power Off`,
:guilabel:`Restart`, :guilabel:`Edit`, :guilabel:`Devices`, and
:guilabel:`Delete` options.

Some buttons are available for all VMs:

* :guilabel:`Delete` :ref:`removes the VM <Deleting VMs>`.

* :guilabel:`Devices` is used to add, remove, and edit the VM devices.

When a VM is not running, these buttons are available:

* |ui-power| (Red) starts the VM. A confirmation dialog appears and
  offers the option to :guilabel:`Overcommit Memory`. Memory
  overcommitment allows multiple VMs to be launched when there is not
  enough free memory for configured RAM of all VMs. Use with caution.
  The |web-ui| displays a substantive error message when a VM fails to
  start.

* :guilabel:`Edit` changes VM settings, and includes an option to
  :guilabel:`Clone` an existing VM. Cloning makes a copy of the VM.
  The new clone has :samp:`_clone{N}` added to the name, where
  :samp:`{N}` is the number of the clone. %brand% will display a
  substantive error message if cloning a VM fails.


When a VM is already running, these buttons are available:

* |ui-power| (Green) shuts down the VM.

* :guilabel:`Stop` also shuts down the VM.

* :guilabel:`Power off` immediately halts the VM. This is equivalent
  to disconnecting the power to a physical computer.

* :guilabel:`Restart` shuts down and immediately starts the VM.

* :guilabel:`CONNECT` displays options to connect to the VM. This can
  include :guilabel:`VNC` or a :guilabel:`Serial` shell. For
  :guilabel:`VNC`, the VM must have a VNC device with
  :guilabel:`Web Interface` enabled.


Popups ask to confirm the choice when starting, shutting down, powering
off, or deleting a VM.


.. index:: Deleting VMs
.. _Deleting VMs:

Deleting VMs
------------

A VM is deleted by clicking |ui-options| on the desired VM card,
then :guilabel:`Delete`. A dialog prompts for confirmation.

.. tip:: :ref:`Zvols <Adding Zvols>` used in
   :ref:`disk devices <vms-disk-device>` and image files used in
   :ref:`raw file <vms-raw-file>` devices are *not* removed when a VM
   is deleted. These resources can be removed manually after it is
   determined that the data in them has been backed up or is no longer
   needed.


.. index:: Docker Hosts
.. _Docker Hosts:

Docker Hosts
------------

`Docker <https://www.docker.com/what-docker>`__
is open source software for automating application deployment
inside containers. A container provides a complete filesystem,
runtime, system tools, and system libraries, so applications always
see the same environment.

`Rancher <https://rancher.com/>`__
is a |web-ui| tool for managing Docker containers.

%brand% runs the Rancher |web-ui| within the Docker Host.


.. index:: Docker Host Requirements
.. _Docker Host Requirements:

Docker Host Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The system BIOS **must** have virtualization support enabled for a
Docker Host to run properly after installation. On Intel systems this is
typically an option called *VT-x*. AMD systems generally have an *SVM*
option.

20 GiB of storage space is required for the Docker Host.

For setup, the :ref:`SSH` service must be enabled.

The Docker Host requires 2 GiB of RAM while running.

enter a new value in the :guilabel:`password` field. Passwords cannot
contain a space.

   Edit Rancher Password in Raw File Device


Start the Docker Host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to
:menuselection:`Virtual Machines`,
then click on the red |ui-power| button of the Docker Host to start it.

Starting a Docker Host can take some time. Connecting to the Serial
Shell is possible during the startup process to view the activity of the
Docker Host. When a message about :literal:`RancherOS` starting appears
and the shell stops posting new messages, press :kbd:`Enter` to see the
:literal:`ClientHost login:` text and continue to log in.


SSH into the Docker Host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to SSH into a running Docker Host. Go
to the
:menuselection:`Virtual Machines` page and find the card for the Docker
Host. The card shows the :guilabel:`Com Port` for the Docker Host. In
this example, :literal:`/dev/nmdm12B` is used.

Use an SSH client to connect to the %brand% server. Remember this also
requires the :ref:`SSH` service to be running. Depending on the %brand%
system configuration, it might also require changes to the
:guilabel:`SSH` service settings, like setting
:guilabel:`Login as Root with Password`.

At the %brand% console prompt, connect to the Rancher Host with
`cu <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=cu>`__, replacing
:samp:`{/dev/nmdm12B}` with the value from the Docker Host
:guilabel:`Com Port`:

.. code-block:: none

   cu -l /dev/nmdm12B -s 9600


If the terminal does not show a :literal:`rancher login:` prompt,
press :kbd:`Enter`. The Docker Host can take some time to start and
display the login prompt.


Installing and Configuring the Rancher Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to
:menuselection:`Virtual Machines`
and locate the card for the Docker Host. Start the Host and click
:guilabel:`Connect` and :guilabel:`Serial` to open the Host Serial shell.

Continuing to set up the Rancher Host is done from the command line.
Enter *rancher* as the username, press :kbd:`Enter`, then enter either
the default password *docker* or the custom password created by editing
the raw file. Press :kbd:`Enter` again. After logging in, a
:literal:`[rancher@ClientHost ~]$` prompt is displayed.

Ensure Rancher has functional networking and can :command:`ping` an
outside website. Adjust the VM
:ref:`Network Interface <vms-network-interface>` and reboot the VM
if necessary.

Download and install the Rancher system with this command:

.. code-block:: none

   sudo docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped -p 8080:8080 rancher/server


.. note:: If the error :literal:`Cannot connect to the Docker daemon`
   is shown, run :command:`sudo dockerd`. Then give the
   :command:`sudo docker run` command above again.


Installation time varies with processor and network connection speed,
but typically takes a few minutes. After the process finishes and a
command prompt is shown, type this command:

.. code-block:: none

   ifconfig eth0 | grep 'inet addr'


The first value is the IP address of the Rancher server. Enter the IP
address and port :literal:`8080` as the URL in a web browser. For
example, if the IP address was :literal:`10.231.3.208`, enter
:literal:`10.231.3.208:8080` as the URL in the web browser.

The Rancher server takes a few minutes to start. The web browser might
show a connection error while the Rancher |web-ui| is still starting. If
the browser shows a :literal:`connection has timed out` or a similar
error, wait one minute and try again.

In the Rancher |web-ui|, click :guilabel:`Add a host`, ensure the radial
:guilabel:`This site's address` button is set, and click
:guilabel:`Save`. Follow the instructions that now display and run the
:command:`sudo docker run --rm --privileged -v` command in the Docker
Host Serial shell. After the command runs a message displays
:literal:`Launched Rancher Agent:`. Refresh or go to the
:guilabel:`Hosts` page of the Rancher |web-ui| to confirm the Docker
Host displays in the |web-ui|. Rancher is now configured and ready for
use.

`Documentation <https://rancher.com/docs/os/v1.x/en/>`__.
